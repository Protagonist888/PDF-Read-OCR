ABSTRACT

Lineament analysis of digitally filtered gravity and aeromagnetic data for that portion of north-central Kansas bounded by
38.5°N. and 40.0°N. latitude and 96.0°W. and 98.0°W. longitude
suggests the basement is characterized by a bimodal set of linear
compositional discontinuities. These discontinuities are interpreted to reflect an intrabasement fracture pattern with modal
orientations of about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. These prefered
orientations are also expressed as linear elements in a revised
contour map of the Precambrian surface configuration, indicating
Phanerozoic movement has taken place along many of them. The northwest-oriented fracture set parallels regional basement fault zones
associated with the Middle Proterozoic(?) Missouri gravity low and
may have resulted from the tensional(?) stresses responsible for
formation of that feature. The north-northeast-oriented set parallels the central axis of the Midcontinent rift system and probably
reflects extensive tensional faulting inferred to have accompanied
the Middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) rifting. Alternatively, both
sets could reflect even older upper-crustal anisotropy. Clustering
of historic earthquake and recent microquake epicenters around
several of these fracture zones demonstrates that some are still
active. Such recurrent seismicity, perhaps in combination with
differential isostatic rebound since Pleistocene glaciation, could
provide a mechanism for upward propagation of these zones.

ABSTRACT

Lineament analysis of digitally filtered gravity and aeromagnetic data for that portion of north-central Kansas bounded by
38.5°N. and 40.0°N. latitude and 96.0°W. and 98.0°W. longitude
suggests the basement is characterized by a bimodal set of linear
compositional discontinuities. These discontinuities are interpreted to reflect an intrabasement fracture pattern with modal
orientations of about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. These prefered
orientations are also expressed as linear elements in a revised
contour map of the Precambrian surface configuration, indicating
Phanerozoic movement has taken place along many of them. The northwest-oriented fracture set parallels regional basement fault zones
associated with the Middle Proterozoic(?) Missouri gravity low and
may have resulted from the tensional(?) stresses responsible for
formation of that feature. The north-northeast-oriented set parallels the central axis of the Midcontinent rift system and probably
reflects extensive tensional faulting inferred to have accompanied
the Middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) rifting. Alternatively, both
sets could reflect even older upper-crustal anisotropy. Clustering
of historic earthquake and recent microquake epicenters around
several of these fracture zones demonstrates that some are still
active. Such recurrent seismicity, perhaps in combination with
differential isostatic rebound since Pleistocene glaciation, could
provide a mechanism for upward propagation of these zones.

Although surface faults are virtually unknown from the study

area, correlation between the locations and modal orientations of

the inferred basement fractures and both Landsat photolineaments,
and linear drainage segments, is good to fair. This may imply that
many of these fractures are expressed at the present land surface as
zones of preferential weathering, perhaps in the form of linear
zones of increased joint density.

Comparison between the magnitudes of nearly 600 hydrogen soil
gas measurements and their relative proximity to these suspected
fractures indicates that at least some of these zones may extend to
the present land surface and act as preferential conduits for vertical migration of free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. However,
it is concluded that the present soil-gas sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0
mi.) is too coarse to accurately define the exact surface traces of
these fractures. The viability of future exploitation of the hydrogen is still unknown, but will probably depend on more precise
definition of these zones, the presence of a suitable trapping
mechanism, and drilling and completion practices appropriate for the

occurrence.

INTRODUCTION

Background Information

In 1982, unusually high concentrations of free hydrogen (30 to
40 mole %) and nitrogen (60 to 70 mole %) were detected in casinghead gases of the CFA Oil Co. #1 Scott well in northwest Morris

County, Kansas (Goebel, et al., 1983a; 1983b) and the CFA Oil Co. #1

Heins well (Plate 1) in southern Geary County, Kansas (Goebel, et
al., 1984). Hydrogen was subsequently detected during actual
drilling of several other nearby wells (Goebel, et al., 1985) and
numerous hydrogen anomalies were indicated along two soil-gas sample
traverses (Plate 1) run by the Kansas and U.S. Geological Surveys in
1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986; McCauley and Watney, 1984). Although
the origin of the nitrogen has remained somewhat of an enigma, a
search of the relevant literature revealed a minimum of eight possible mechanisms for generating such anomalously high concentrations

of hydrogen in the subsurface (Angino, et al., 1984). The absence

of appreciable CH, or CO, with the gases is indicative of an abiogenic source for the hydrogen. Isotopic ratios and thermodynamic
calculations yield possible equilibration temperatures around 10
degrees C or lower (somewhat below ambient temperature), implying a
deuturium-depleted gas source. The currently most plausible origins
for the Kansas occurrences include ground-water mixing, mantle outgassing, and the the hydration of FeO-rich minerals (for example
olivine) during serpentinization/deserpentinization of mafic or

ultramafic rocks (Coveny, et al., 1987). Of these theories, the

t al., 1988), and close proximity to
several known kimberlite plugs (Mansker, et al., 1987). Analyses of
gases exsolved from drilling muds during drilling of the CFA Oil #1
Simpson well (Coveney, et al., 1987, fig. 3), CFA Oil #1 Amthauer
well (Plate 1), and wireline well logs of other nearby wells
(Goebel, 1985) have established a stratigraphic range for the hydrogen extending from soil level to the top of the Precambrian basement, further suggesting an intrabasement source.

Although the maximum areal extent of the occurrence is still
rather poorly defined, soil-gas sampling along extensive traverses
(Plate 1) indicates areas in at least 10 Kansas counties are
involved. The highest levels of hydrogen detected along initial
soil-gas traverses were from near the centers of “unusually
straight" stream valleys and an area of Pleistocene(?) age sand
dunes northwest of Abilene (Angino, 1985). Although Phanerozoic
strata in the area of the gas occurrences are essentially flat
lying, the locations and orientations of many streams and rivers in
eastern Kansas are thought to have been influenced by regional joint
trends (Baehr, 1954; McCauley, et al., 1975), near-surface faults
(DuBois, 1978), and reactivated basement fracture zones (Kirk, 1968:
Berendsen, et al., 1978). This suggests that both the near-surface

concentrations and subsurface movements of the hydrogen may be

strongly fracture controlled. If this is true, then knowledge of

ne Ne A A NR OT

the fracture patterns may provide a fundamental key to understanding
the origin, possible trapping, and potential development of this
resource. Although down-hole gas pressures have so far been quite

low (slightly above 1 atm., Coveney, et al., 1987, p. 42), it is

conceivable that such widespread occurrences of anomalous soil-gas
hydrogen could represent the surface expression of a very significant (if economically extractable) future source of energy and raw
materials. Indeed, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986, p. 120) have

predicted that "in the future the extraction and refining of gases

containing hydrogen will become a separate branch of industry."

Study Objectives

In an attempt to clarify further any relationship between
subsurface fractures and hydrogen gas distribution, an integrated
analysis of geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and remotely sensed
data was undertaken for a large area of north-central Kansas. The
primary objectives of this study as originally stated were: 1) to
determine the fracture pattern of the study area with an emphasis on
remote techniques, 2) to relate fracture types and trends to possible tectonic origin(s) and modern crustal stress regime, 3) to
compare hydrogen soil-gas anomalies with fracture locations, and 4)

to develop a working model for subsurface movement of the hydrogen.

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA

Location and Surficial Geology

The study area comprises that portion of north-central Kansas
lying between 96 and 98 degrees west longitude and 38.5 and 40
degrees north latitude, corresponding to the entire Manhattan and
northern one half of the Hutchinson 1:250,000-scale series U.S.
Geological Survey topographic quadrangle sheets. It covers
approximately 28,500 km” (11,000 mi.) of surface area and includes
all or portions of 25 Kansas counties (Figure 1).

Strata cropping out in the study area range from Late Pennsylvanian through Recent in age (Kansas Geological Survey, 1964).
Late Paleozoic and Cretaceous rocks include a sequence of
interlayered marine carbonates and fine terrigenous clastics. The
Middle Permian age Wellington Formation crops out in the central
portion of the study area. It includes a thick salt sequence, the
Hutchinson Salt Member, in much of the Kansas subsurface (Watney and
Paul, 1980), but this salt has been removed from all except the
southwesternmost part of the study area by surface erosion and
subsurface solution (Plate 1). Deposits of Cenozoic age are of
generally minor importance except for thick alluvial fills in larger
stream valleys and a mantle of Pleistocene glaciofluvial sediments
northeast of the Kansan age glacial terminus (Plate 1). Locally in
northern Dickinson and portions of surrounding counties, sandy areas
and small sand dunes of Quaternary age occur on the uplands (Dunlap,

1977; Jantz and Saffry, 1980; Sloanaker, 1950).

Basement Lithologies and Proterozoic Tectonics

The lithologic and structural characteristics of Precambrian
rocks in north-central Kansas are known only from widely scattered
drill hole samples and regional correlations. Holes penetrating
basement rocks within the study area number only about 280, but most
of these occur in a few areas of higher drilling density (Plate 4)
and very few were drilled more than a few meters (10’s of feet) into
Precambrian rocks (Bickford, et al., 1979, 1981; Denison, et al.,
1984). Among the notable exceptions to this general depth rule are
the Hodgen Oil #1 and #1-4 Finn wells in Marshall County, and the
Texaco USA #1-31 Poersch well in Washington County (Plate 1). The
Finn wells both penetrated over 450 m. (1500 ft.) of Precambrian
rocks, and Poersch well is reported to have penetrated approximately
2600 m. (8,450 ft.) of Precambrian gabbros, basalts, and arkosic
clastics (Berendsen et al., 1988). An extensive discussion of the
units encountered in the Poersch well and their possible interpretation is available from Berendsen and others (1988). Unfortunately,
no additional data are currently available for the Finn wells.

The study area lies within the Central Plains tectonic province
(Figure 2), an early Proterozoic accretionary terrane consisting
predominantly of mesozonal granitoid rocks and gneissic metamorphic
rocks of primarily amphibolite grade facies (Bickford, et al., 1986;
Sims and Peterman, 1986). Because rocks of this province are exposed at the surface only in southeastern Wyoming, it has been defined

primarily on the basis of gross geophysical expression, and the

analysis of limited cuttings and core samples available from drill

holes. Most of these samples possess cataclastic textures, suggesting they underwent a period of extensive shearing and deformation
after emplacement. Those samples that have been radiometrically
dated yield early Proterozoic ages ranging from 1,800 to 1,600
million years ago (Ma). Locally within the province a set of anorogenic plutons dated between 1,480 and 1,450 Ma occurs. They yield
nondeformed samples, and thus roughly bracket the timing of the
shearing episode (Denison, et al., 1984, p. (C7). A northwestsoutheast-oriented tectonic grain (Figure 3) that may also reflect
this deformation has been inferred for the terrane in eastern Kansas

and western Missouri (Bickford, et al., 1986; Sims and Peterman,

1986) largely on the basis of geophysical and structural trends.
Farther east in central Missouri, a northwest-southeast-trending
gravity low (the Missouri gravity low) and corresponding set of
structural features (Missouri tectonic zone) has been mapped within
the province that has been variously interpreted as a rifted arm of

a possible "rrr-type" type triple junction (Guinness, et al., 1982;

Kisvarsanyi, 1984), major transcurrent fault (Arvidson, t al

1982), or collisional suture (Bowring, et al., 1988) that apparently
predated a middle Proterozoic (1,485 to 1,350 Ma) epizonal graniterhyolite terrane underlying much of southern Missouri, southern
Kansas, and Oklahoma. Detailed analysis of regional aeromagnetic
data in south-central Kansas by Gay (1986, 1988) suggests that an
more complex history of Proterozoic tectonism than previously

supposed may be recorded in the basement there.

gravity maps (eg. Hildenbrand, et al., 1982) and magnetic maps (eg.
Zietz, 1982) is the Midcontinent geophysical anomaly (MGA). The MGA
corresponds to the middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) age "central
North America rift system" (CNARS) of Ocola and Meyer (1973), also
known as the "Midcontinent rift system". The CNARS extends from
Lake Superior southwest to at least the southern boarder of Kansas
(Figure 2) and may continue into Oklahoma (Yarger, 1983). Basalts
cropping out in the Lake Superior region and sampled in boreholes
into the CNARS farther south yield middle Proterozoic radiometric
ages ranging from 1,250 to 950 Ma (Berendsen, et al., 1988).

The CNARS has generally been interpreted as an "aborted rift,"
but debate continues about the precise plate-tectonic event that
produced this apparent failure (Gordon and Hempton, 1983). The
CNARS cuts obliquely across the previously established Archean and
Proterozoic accretionary margins (Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985) and
this may have been a factor in its "failure." Several apparent
offsets occur along the trend of the CNARS and these have generally
been interpreted as transform faults (Carlson and Treves, 1988;
Chase and Gilmer, 1973), but Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 373)
suggested "the rift system was deflected along preexisting structures" at these locations. This latter interpretation agrees with
Ramberg and Smithson’s (1975) conclusion that rift-related faulting
generally follows preexisting fractures locally and the major trends
of rift zones reflect deep-seated crustal inhomogeneities. One such
offset occurs just north of the study area in southeastern Nebraska

and may correspond with the northwest extension of the older(?)

10
Missouri gravity low mentioned above (Arvidson, et al., 1982).
The study area lies astride the northern Kansas portion of the
CNARS (Figure 2). Early interpretations of the CNARS structure in

Kansas (Coons, 1966; Coons, et al., 1967; Scott, 1969) proposed a

central basalt-cored horst block and two flanking clastic basins.
Deep seismic reflection profiling over the CNARS in 1981 by the
Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) program in
northeastern Kansas (Plate 1) has confirmed its rift nature (Brown,
et al., 1983; Gries, 1984; Serpa, et al., 1984), but according to
their interpretation, the CNARS is now thought to consist of an
asymmetric fault-bounded basin roughly 80 km (50 mi.) wide and upto
8 km (5 mi.) deep. The basin is apparently segmented into several
sub-basins by major east-dipping normal faults and these are now
known to be filled with an interlayered sequence of coeval basalt
(900 to 1100 Ma) and arkosic clastics deposited during the time of
rifting (Berendsen, et al., 1988; Dickas and Mundrey, 1988). This
sequence of clastics, loosely termed the Rice Formation by Scott
(1966), had received considerable attention recently as a possible
commercial hydrocarbon source (Dickas, 1984; Fritz, 1985; Gustavson,
1983; Herman, et al., 1985; Lee and Kerr, 1983, 1984; McCaslin,
1984; Newell, et al., 1988a, p. 3), although initial testing has

been disappointing (Berendsen, et al., 1988). The presence of a

large mafic intrusive body at mid-crustal levels underlying the
central portion of the rift basin is indicated by gravity modelling

(Somanas, 1984) and a low velocity body in the upper mantle is

suggested by teleseismic residuals data (Hahn, 1980; Miller, 1983).

een et aren en a rn hE

Near the Lake Superior area, the rift zone is characterized by
two prominent sets of faults: a set of high-angle flanking faults
striking parallel to the trend of the rift, and a second set of
shorter but more numerous transverse faults striking generally
perpendicular to the trend of the rift and cutting the older set
(see Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985, Fig. 4, p. 370). Although they
were probably originally high-angle normal faults generated during
Keweenawan time by the tensional forces responsible for the rifting
event, some of the flanking faults now possess considerable reverse
stratigraphic throw and must therefore represent subsequent compression of the rift zone. For example, there is an indication on deep
seismic reflection data in southwestern Iowa that substantial Precambrian reverse throw may be present along certain rift-related
faults there (Herman, et al., 1985, p. 25). Reprocessing and interpretation of the Kansas COCORP data has also suggested possible

thrust displacements (Berendsen, et

1., 1988, p. 12) along features

previously supposed to be listric normal faults (Serpa, et al.,

1984). Few of the transverse faults in the outcrop area show this
reverse sense of movement. Because similar sets of "gridded" (axisperpendicular and axis-parallel) faults characterize many rifts
worldwide (Ramberg and Smithson, 1975), it seems reasonable to
assume such a set also typifies the CNARS in the subsurface to the
south and west of the Lake Superior area. In fact, Berendsen and
others (1988, Fig. 18) portray such a gridded fault pattern for a

portion of the CNARS in northernmost Kansas, which includes roughly

the northeastern third of the study area (Figure 4).

Contrary to the statement by Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 376)
that the CNARS shows little evidence of post-Keweenawan reactivation,
the Midcontinent rift in Kansas appears to correspond to an area of
periodic epierogenic deformation and Paleozoic faulting, relatively
abundant modern seismicity and active basement faults, and numerous
kimberlite intrusives (see below). These features, in addition to a
Cambrian age (545 Ma) carbonatite intrusion just north of the study

t al., 1975a, 1975b; Carlson, 1988)

area in Nebraska (Brookins,
attest to the deeply fractured and periodically reactivated nature
of the Midcontinent crust along the CNARS (Nishimori and Powell,

1980, p. 30-39; Sykes, 1978).

Phanerozoic History

In comparison with the Proterozoic, the Phanerozoic depositional history and structure of the study area is relatively well
known. Lower and middle Paleozoic strata preserved in the subsurface of the study area consist predominantly of marine carbonates
and siliciclastics deposited near the margin of the relatively
stable North Kansas basin (Figure 5). During this time period,
plate tectonic interactions at the continental margins produced
generally minor, epeirogenic deformation over portions of the CNARS
in Kansas (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4) and other basementinvolved structures throughout much of the Midcontinent. At least
three such orogenic episodes are recorded in the form of regional

unconformities and thickness trends within the lower and middle

Paleozoic strata of the study area (Willoughby and Berendsen, 1978a,

1978b), and locally as anomalous lithologies (Berendsen and Doveton,
1988). Detailed discussions of the gross regional Paleozoic stratigraphic and structural relations preserved in the study area are
available elsewhere (Lee, 1943, 1956).

Near the close of Mississippian time the collision of the
southern margin of the present North American plate with the South
African plate produced north-northwest-directed principal horizontal
stress, culminating in the Early Pennsylvanian Ouchita orogeny.
Compressive stress was propagated cratonward from the Ouachita orogenic front of northern Arkansas and southern Oklahoma and produced
major uplift along the Humboldt fault zone, Abilene anticline, and
similar structures throughout much of the Midcontinent (Carlson,
1988; Howe, 1988). This Late Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and (7)
Early Permian tectonic episode resulted in the formation of the
Nemaha anticline which subdivided the former North Kansas Basin into
the present day Salina and Forest City basins (Figure 6). This
uplift may have been a result of convergent left-lateral strike-slip
(wrench) faulting along preexisting northeast-trending basement
faults (Blair and Berendsen, 1985, 1988; Davis, 1984; Fenster and
Trapp, 1982; Heyl, 1977; Phipps, 1983). Detailed subsurface studies
indicate the Nemaha anticline/Humboldt fault zone consists of a
complex series of scissor faults, sigmoid anticlines, horst and
graben features, pull-apart basins (Berendsen and Blair, 1986a;
Eccles, 1981; Newell, 1987; Steeples, 1982), en-echelon fault zones
(Fath, 1920, 1921; Foley, 1926), reverse-slip faults (Smith and

Anders, 1951; Steeples and Yarger, 1983), and anastomosing fault

zones (Burchett and Arrigo, 1978), all of which are features
consistent with wrench fault deformation (eg. Harding, 1973; Maxwell
and Wise, 1958; Moody, 1973; Moody and Hill, 1956, 1964; Prucha,

1964; Sylvester, 1982; Wilcox, et al., 1973). Thus, the Humboldt

fault zone within the study area almost certainly represents a riftmarginal fault complex of the CNARS in Kansas that was reactivated
periodically throughout the Paleozoic (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, p.

4; Serpa, et al., 1984; Somanas, 1984; Yarger, 1983, p. 29).

Minor continued uplift along the Nemaha structural trend, and
to a lesser extent the associated Abilene anticline (Figure 7),
through Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian times produced significant bathymetric irregularities which had a pronounced local control
on marginal marine depositional environments and biota (Fisher,
1980; Lorenzen, 1973; Sporleder, 1987; Stewart, 1963, p. 12) as well
as important regional and local effects on overall sequence thicknesses and lithologies (Eccles, 1981; Merriam, 1963, p. 98-101, 107112, 118-119). Similar apparent Pennsylvanian and Permian lithotectonic relationships have been suggested elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Watney and Wilson, 1983), although they may have resulted
in part from passive differential compaction over existing structures (Gentile, 1968, 1979, 1984, p. 36; Steeples and Yarger, 1983).

Mesozoic and Tertiary strata are not present over the uplift
within the study area, having either never been deposited, or else,
deposited and subsequently removed. However, studies of overlapping
relations to the north in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa indicate

the Nemaha anticline was again uplifted during the Cretaceous to

early Tertiary Laramide orogeny (Bunker, 1981; Bunker, et al., 1981;
Carlson, 1988). The presence of numerous Cretaceous-age kimberlite
intrusives in close proximity to the uplift (Plate 1) has also been
cited as evidence for renewed tectonic activity during Laramide time
by Chelikowsky (1972), Fenster and Trapp (1982), and Taylor (1950).
The northwest-southeast orientations of kimberlite outcrops and
their associated magnetic anomalies have been cited as evidence for
emplacement along similarly oriented fractures (Brookins, 1970a,
1970b; Mansker, et al., 1987). Chelikowsky argued on the basis of
these orientations, regional joint trends, and major fault geometries for right-lateral reactivation of the Abilene anticline and
Humboldt fault system in response to east-west directed Laramide
principal horizontal stresses, although the evidence for such an
interpretation is not clearcut (Steeples, 1982, p. 58-59). It does
seem possible that considerable stress could have been transmitted
as far cratonward as north-central Kansas on the basis of Bird's
(1984, Fig. 10) model for Laramide foreland deformation and associated Great Plains crustal thickening. The Chadron-Cambridge arch, a
structurally related uplift of western Nebraska and northern Kansas
(Figure 6), was apparently rejuvenated as recently as the Pliocene
and Pleistocene (Stanley and Wayne, 1972).

Seismic activity has persisted along the CNARS to the present
time as evidenced by historic earthquake epicenter data (Burchett,

et al., 1983; DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Eccles, 1981) and microquake

records (Steeples, et al., 1987). The modern principal horizontal

stress (PHS) is oriented approximately east-northeast/west-southwest

20

throughout much of the Midcontinent according to regional well-bore
breakout data, earthquake fault-plane solutions, and various

measures of in-situ stress (Dart, 1987; Zoback and Zoback, 1980).

Faults and Joints

At present, northern Kansas lies within the Prairie Plains
monocline structural province of the central stable region of the
North American craton (Jewett, 1951). Regional dips of a few meters
per kilometer (about 14 feet per mile) or less (<l degree) to the
west are common, although smaller structures can have important
local effects. Only a few surface faults have been recognized
within the Paleozoic rocks of the study area and all are relatively
small in length and vertical displacement (Bruton, 1958; Eccles,
1981; Hooker, 1956; Underwood and Polson, 1987, 1988). Even fewer
surface faults have been mapped previously within Cretaceous strata
of the study area (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962). The Humboldt fault
zone may reach the surface in Nemaha and northeastern Pottawatomie
counties (Du Bois, 1978; Ratcliff, 1957), but this has been disputed
(Seyrafian, 1977). Published studies of subsurface structure in the
vicinity of study area oil and gas fields suggest basement-involved
faulting has played an important role in localizing many of these
accumulations (Curtis, 1960; Smith and Anders, 1951). Berendsen and
others (1988, p. 4) state that Paleozoic reactivation of study area
basement faults resulted in the formation of many Kansas structures.
This is in accordance with the findings of Merriam (1963, p. 227)

that a close correlation exists between the orientations of 99

21

subsurface anticlines (Figure 8A) and 50 suspected subsurface faults
(Figure 8B) in central and northwestern Kansas. Berendsen and Blair
(1986a) utilized subsurface elevations from 3,794 wells to construct
a series of contour maps for six important Paleozoic horizons in
central Kansas, including approximately the southern fourth of the
study area. They mapped a large number of previously named structural features, as well as many unrecognized structures, including
numerous possible subsurface faults. Their maps also show a close
correlation exists between the locations and orientations of faults
and anticlines in central Kansas.

Although joints are the most common fractures observed in the
outcrops of Kansas, they have received only limited study. Prominent regional joint sets striking N.2-4°E. and N.10-14°W. in the
Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation of Hamilton County were remarked
upon by Bass (1926, p. 80). Although not in Kansas, Melton’s (1929)
early work in Oklahoma deserves mention here. He measured approximately 4,000 joint trends in Pennsylvanian and Lower Permian rocks
at 106 localities in central and southeastern Oklahoma. He determined a dominant set strikes N.37°W., correlating closely with the
strike of faults in the eastern Oklahoma "en echelon" fault belt
(Fath, 1920, 1921, p. 150-155), and a less prominent set strikes
about N.65°E. Neff (1949) compiled a large number of joint orientations for Lower Permian limestones cropping out in each township of
Riley County and determined the existence of a primary set oriented
about N.72°E. and a subsidiary, somewhat variable, set striking

about N.25°W. He postulated that the primary set developed in

response to late Paleozoic northwest-southeast directed tensile
stress, and the secondary set developed differentially in response
to irregularities of local basement structure (i.e. Nemaha and
Abilene anticlines). Nelson (1952) mapped an unstated number of
joint trends in the Permian limestones of Marshall County and determined (p. 31) a major set strikes at N.76°E. and a minor set strikes
at N.15°W. He combined these findings with Neff's (1949) data from
adjacent Riley County in an attempt to determine any influences of
Precambrian basement structures on the surface fracture pattern of
the area. He concluded (p. 54-59) that the joint pattern expressed
at the present land surface reflects an "upward transmission and
progressive rotation" of a much older basement joint pattern.

Wagner (1961) used low-altitude aerial photos to map joint
traces in Upper Pennsylvanian limestones and sandstones over much of
Wilson County and recorded two general groups of N.55°E. and N.35°W.
Stewart (1962) used a similar method to map 10,065 fracture (joint)
traces in northern Cleveland County, central Oklahoma (due south of
Sumner County, Kansas). He demonstrated a prominent set oriented at
about N.49°E. and a secondary mode at about N.24°W. Later Stewart
(1967) recorded 881 joint orientations on outcrops of four Upper
Pennsylvanian limestones of Atchison, Jefferson, Douglas, and Osage
counties. He documented a dominant set of "shear" joints trending
N.60°E., a less common set of tension joints trending N.35°W., and a
third set of short, tight joints trending about N.3°E. Ward (1968)
measured the orientations of 5,777 joints in Upper Pennsylvanian and

Lower Permian limestone outcrops of Butler, Cowley, Greenwood,

24
Chase, and Marion counties. He found two prominent sets with orientations that also average N.60°E. and N.35°W. He stated (p. 21-22)
that no correlation was apparent between the orientations of joints
and underlying faults, the joints were post-Early Permian and preEarly Cretaceous in age, and they may have formed as a result of
northwest-southeast directed horizontal compressive stress generated
during the uplift of the Ouchita Mountains. Jefferis (1969) measured approximately 320 joint orientations in two Upper Pennsylvanian
limestones of southern Douglas County. He found (p. 20, Fig. 9) two
sets of well developed joints trending about N.63°E. and N.41°W, and
a third set of short and tight joints trending about N.2°W. Hagen
(1972, 1985) mapped the surface traces of 2615 joints in Lower
Permian limestones of Osage and Kay counties in north-central Oklahoma (just south of Cowley County, Kansas) as they might relate to
waterflooding success. He found a "remarkably uniform" major set at
N.70°E. and a much less common mean at N.35°W. DuBois (1978) measured the orientations of an unstated number of joints in Lower
Permian limestones of northestern Nemaha County. She found two
pronounced sets oriented at about N.85°E. and N.35W. Macfarlane
(1979) measured about 180 joints in Lower Permian limestones of
northeastern Morris County. He found (his Plate C) a prominent set
at N.45°E. and a less common set at N.52°W. Hoppie (1980) measured
311 joints on 98 outcrops of the Lower Cretaceous Kiowa Shale and
Lower(?) Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone, and 190 joints from 48 exposures of the Upper Cretaceous Greenhorn Limestone in Ottawa, Cloud,

and Mitchell counties. He found (p. 52, Fig. 12) one well-developed

25

set trending N.83°W. in the Greenhorn Limestone, but no distinct
modes were apparent in data for the older clastic units. He concluded that the joints of the Cretaceous rocks of north-central Kansas
were not formed in the same tectonic province as those in the upper
Paleozoic strata of eastern Kansas. Eccles (1981) documented a few
joint trends in Lower Permian Limestones of western Wabaunsee and
eastern Riley counties. He determined (p. 40) means of N.76°E. and
N.12°W. for joints in Wabaunsee County, and (p. 45) means of N.65°E.
and N.21°W. for Riley County sets.

The most recent studies of Kansas joint orientations and their
possible origins are those of Drees (1974) and Neuhauser (1983,
1986). They measured the orientations of 250 joints in the Upper
Cretaceous Fort Hays Limestone Member of Ellis County and determined
a dominant set strikes N.70°W. and a less prominant set strikes
N.25°E. Neuhauser attributed the formation of these two sets to a
conjugate shear couple developed in response to nearly east-west
directed compressive stress of probable early Tertiary (late-Laramide orogeny) age.

A summary of relevant statistics for each of the foregoing
studies is presented in map form on Figure 9. Each symbol represents a single study, and the orientation and length of each ray
corresponds to the orientation and relative abundance of each joint
set measured in a given study. Note the relative consistancy of the
two sets expressed in Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks, and their
distinct discordance with sets in the Cretaceous strata to the west.

Drainage Pattern

The drainage pattern of Kansas and its origin represents an
interesting aspect of Kansas geology that has received rather sporadic attention over the years, but little detailed study. At first
glance, the drainage network over much of Kansas appears to demonstrate a "textbook example" of the basic dendritic pattern expected
for areas of flat-lying rocks of fairly uniform lithology (Howard,
1967). However, on closer inspection (Plate 2) it becomes apparent
that certain orientations are more prevalent than others, producing
a distinctly subdendritic to rectangular drainage pattern. This
deviation from purely dentritic suggests some form of structural
control influenced drainage development in Kansas (Morisawa, 1985,
p. 145).

Early works on the relationships between drainage and structure
in Kansas are qualitative to semiquantitative at best. Bass (1928,
1929, p. 17-23) remarked on the pronounced asymmetry of many Kansas
drainage basins and suggested differential weathering effects due to
topographic aspect, rather than structural or tectonic influences,
were the cause. During his study of regional joint systems, Nelson
(1952) noted the distinctly rectangular nature of the drainage
pattern in Riley and Marshall counties. He stated (p. 47) "probably
more than 75 percent of the streams in Riley County show some joint

control." Melton (1959) determined the relative frequencies of

28
drainage orientations in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma and
found that the most abundant stream trends were strongly correlated
with the solar insolation angle (i.e. oriented preferentially northsouth) and secondarily with regional joint patterns. This solar
influence on drainage was most pronounced in lower order basins,
whereas apparent joint effects were strongest on higher order
streams. This conclusion differs somewhat from the findings of
Baehr (1954) who studied drainage and rock structure in three small
drainage basins in Geary and Riley counties, Kansas. Baehr stated
(p. 57) that bedding and joints acted as the primary controls on
headward migration of gullies and minor tributaries cutting the
thick Permian limestones of his study area. He did not attribute
any components to nongeologic (i.e. solar) effects.

Merriam (1955, p. 82) commented briefly on the obvious angularity of drainage patterns in western Kansas and later (Merriam, 1963,
p. 254) suggested a bedrock fracture control. Kirk (1968) noted a
rectilinear pattern existed for much of the drainage pattern of
eastern Kansas. He correlated the prominent stream trends with
surface fractures, basement faults, earthquake epicenter distribution, geophysical anomaly trends, and the location of surface igneous intrusions, but offered no quantitative data in support. Ward
(1968) remarked (p. 15) on the apparent influence of regional joint
sets on both the overall drainage pattern, and the specific locations of many smaller drainageways. Chelikowsky (1972, p. 7) also
mentioned an "angular pattern" to the drainage network of Riley

County which he attributed to the regional joint pattern, but did

29

not offer any data to support this assertion. Hagen (1972, 1985),
during his study of joints in north-central Oklahoma, noticed that
they had apparently exercised a strong control on drainage orientations. He ascribed a less prominent north-south drainage maximum
(Melton’s “solar insolation effect"?) to bedding control and all
minor orientations to "Precambrian shears." McNaughton (1974;

McCauley, et al., 1975) utilized an optical Fourier transform of

Landsat satellite imagery to define dominant stream trends for
several portions of north-central Kansas. They argued that tectonic
influences had produced zones of weakness in the surface strata
along which streams tended to preferentially downcut. Seyrafian
(1977, p. 35-42) examined some straight stream segments during his
study of the Humboldt fault zone in northeastern Pottawatomie County, and concluded that strike-slip faulting might account for their
locations and orientations, although obvious stratigraphic evidence
for faulting was lacking. Berendsen and others (1978) utilized the
linear trends of major eastern Kansas rivers to define structural
lineaments in the Precambrian basement, although they did not state
exactly why this relationship should be true.

More recently, Hoppie (1980) evaluated statistically the possible geologic influences on the morphology, including orientation, of
the Solomon River in north-central Kansas. He concluded that the
orientation of a portion of the river flowing over the Cretaceous
Greenhorn Limestone may have been determined by a well-developed
joint set in this unit, but elsewhere the evidence was inconclusive.

Merriam and Sorensen (1982, Fig. 2) mapped a set of prominent topo
30
inn HN Ne eS LL LATS NAY Rs RU _

graphic lineaments in Elk, Greenwood, and Chautauqua counties,
Kansas, and suggested (p. 3) that they reflect regional basement
fault-block structures.

Most recently, the author (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987) studied the
orientations of 4426 straight drainage segments at three scales
within a large portion of north-central Kansas (including the entire
present study area) in an attempt to clarify this apparent relationship between structure and drainage. A distinct N.0-10°E. drainage
orientation mode (Melton’s (1959) "solar insolation angle" mode?)
occurs in all areas and at all scales examined. However, a satisfactory mechanism (other than "solar insolation") for producing this
trend is still lacking. Among geologic controls, regional joint
trends were most strongly correlated with drainage in small order
drainage basins and regional fold axes correlated best with river
and major stream orientations. Because very few surface faults have
been mapped in this area (see above), correlation between surface
fault trends and drainage orientations was difficult to assess.
However, the finding of Merriam (1963, p. 227) that the orientations
of regional folds in Kansas are strongly correlated with (controlled
by?) regional subsurface fault trends implies that the angular
orientations of many study area rivers and streams were perhaps
determined by subsurface faults, rather than regional joint sets as
previously supposed. This also agrees with a statement of Berendsen
and Blair (1984; 1986a, p. 11) that many suspected central Kansas
subsurface faults have corresponding drainage and topographic

features.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Fracture Detection

A large number of techniques for detecting the locations and
orientations of subsurface fractures exist. These range from geologic methods, such as direct observation of joints and faults in the
field, to a diverse number of geochemical, geophysical, and remote
sensing methods. The suitability of a given technique to a particular application depends on factors such as geologic setting, allowable costs, time considerations, necessary precision in locating
individual fractures, and availablity of supporting information
(Goldstein, 1985).

Among geologic methods, surface studies of fault and joint
orientations have received considerable attention in the past.
Regional joint trends are easily determined from simple outcrop
measurements. Unfortunately, surface joint trends may not reflect
major fracture patterns at depth, (Ludvigson and McAdams, 1980, p.
13). In addition, such studies often contain severe investigatorinduced biases due to improper selection and sampling of outcrops,
and only rarely include important information such as joint spacing
and character (La Pointe and Hudson, 1985). Field mapping may be
useful in defining the locations of major faults, but minor faults
or those with little stratigraphic displacement are easily missed,
particularly in areas with thick vegetative cover or sparse bedrock
exposures. Likewise, in areas where subsurface control is good,

structure mapping can often accurately resolve many fault locations.

tt heer Ne eee sa ce ett arma it

Unfortunately, in areas of widely spaced drill hole data, such as
the Salina Basin area of northern Kansas, even major faults may be
impossible to recognize.

Down-hole studies, such as borehole televiewing and "fracturefinder" type electric logging, can also provide absolute measurements on the locations and orientations of individual fractures, but
must be performed on uncased holes soon after drilling. Similarly,
thin-section studies require the acquisition of oriented cores
during drilling. All down-hole methods suffer from very limited
areal resolution.

Among surface geophysical approaches to fracture detection,
potential-field methods such as gravity and magnetic mapping have
received only limited use, primarily because they tend to reveal
only intrabasement discontinuities and lack the ability to resolve
precisely the locations of individual fractures (Lewis and Haeni,
1987). Electromagnetic methods such as earth resistivity and Very
Low Frequency (VLF) radiowave surveys have been used to detect
subsurface fractures with varying success (Anderson, 1981; Crumpton
and Badgley, 1959; Steele, 1982), but are time-consuming and of
limited applicablity. In regions with fairly high levels of seismicity, for example southern California and Missouri's New Madrid
area, plotting accurately-located earthquake epicenters may produce
alignments that can be related to fracture locations with some
certainty. One of the more widely used methods for mapping natural
fracture systems is high-resolution reflection seismic data (Till
man, 1983, p. 165). Unfortunately, seismic studies suffer from

33
fairly high acquisition and processing costs and the inability to
resolve fractures along which little or no vertical movement has

occured (Aguilera, 1980).

Lineament Analysis

One of the most widely used and almost universally accepted
approaches to mapping fracture locations and orientations is lineament analysis of topographic maps, potential-field geophysical data,
and remotely sensed imagery. In spite of this widespread acceptance
and use, the terminology of lineament analysis is little agreed upon
and has undergone many changes since the time Hobbs (1904, 1911)
first described linear topographic alignments in the landscape of
the northeastern United States. In this paper I will follow the
general definition of a lineament as set forth by Caran and others
(1981) as "a figure that is perceived in an image or other factual
representation of a solid planetary body that is linear and continuous, has definable end points and lateral boundaries, has a relatively high length to width ratio, a descernable azimuth, and is
shown or presumed to correlate with planetary elements whose origin
is geologically controlled." Under this definition, any linear
features perceived on topographic maps, visible or infrared spectral
data (eg. aerialphotos or Landsat satellite images) or any linear
discontinuities on potential-field geophysical data can be termed
lineaments. To reduce confusion somewhat, linear topographic features (including linear stream segments) could be termed “geomorphic

lineaments", linear spectral features could be termed "photolinea
34

ments", and those apparent on geophysical data could be termed
"geophysical lineaments", or more specifically, "gravity lineaments"
and "magnetic lineaments". This is the specific usage followed
herein.

Since the time of Hobbs (1904, 1911) early papers on the subject, geomorphic lineaments and various types of photolineaments
have probably received the most attention as possible indicators of
subsurface fractures (eg. Caran, et al., 1981; Gilluly, 1977; Haman,
1961, 1964). Readily apparent on virtually any topographic map,
aerial photo, or space image of almost any earth terrain (Gay, 1973,
appendix 2), both types lineaments have generally been considered
the surface traces of subsurface fractures of various types. Unfortunately, in many early lineament studies the precise geologic
origin of these lineaments was not addressed or was stated as "unclear". Lineaments were simply mapped and a structural connotation
was assumed with little substantiating data (Anderson, 1981, p. 1).
The apparently limited value of these early investigations (Gilluly,
1977) probably resulted from inadequate study documentation, inconsistent mapping methods, and indiscriminate use of terms such as
"lineation," "lineament," "“photolinear," “linear feature," "“alignment," and "fracture trace," (Caran, et al., 1981; O’Leary and
Friedman, 1978; O'Leary, et al., 1976a, 1976b). Some researchers
could demonstrate good agreement between the trends of shorter
lineaments and the orientations of major (regional) joint sets (eg.

Boyer and McQueen, 1964; Brown, 1961; Dean, et al

— <a ?

1985; Loar,

1985), which strongly suggested a genetic relationship. In other

35

studies a particular linear feature was shown to correspond to a
zone of more intense jointing in the underlying strata (Lattman and
Matzke, 1961) and less often to mappable surface faults (Brown,
1961; Elifrits, 1982; Jefferis, 1969). The largest of linear
features were generally correlated with suspected basement faults
(eg. Dean, et al., 1984; Hughes, 1983; Lattman, 1958; Maughan and
Perry, 1983) and sub-continental sized fracture zones (Wise, 1969).
Salisbury and Merriam (1984) showed that the major Landsat
photolineament orientations present in an area of southeastern Canada and New York with outcropping Precambrian crystalline basement
rocks were also present in adjacent areas where the basement was
overlain by thick lower Paleozoic strata. They suggested that the
tectonic forces responsible for creating these lineaments in both
areas either: 1) post-date the sediments altogether, or 2) that some
other mechanism caused existing pre-Paleozoic lineaments to promulgate upward from the basement subsequent to deposition of the sediments. They favored the latter interpretation. Elsewhere, studies
in terrains covered by Pleistocene glacial deposits and other unconsolidated sediments have indicated bedrock fractures are also represented by corresponding fractures in the overlying deposits and as
photolineaments on images of these areas (DuBois, 1978; Mollard,
1958; Rumsey, 1971; Thumult, 1984). Among the mechanisms that have
been suggested for producing such a upward propagation and surface
expression of deeper fractures are earth tides, earthquakes and
microquakes, plate tectonic compressional and tensional stresses,

earth rotational stresses, and recurrent glacial loading and unload
36
ing (Rumsey, 1971, p. 30-32), and ground-water related processes
(Berger and Aghassy, 1984). Inasmuch as the northeastern portion of
the study area was glaciated during the Pleistocene (Plate 1) and
locations of surface springs and seeps over much of the study area
are probably controlled by near-surface bedrock joints (Donald Whittemore, verbal comm., June 1988), these latter two factors may be
particularly relevant to the present investigation.

Regardless of their precise geologic origin, photolineaments
are now routinely used by geologists for both reconnaissance- level
and detailed structural analysis throughout the world. This is
evidenced by both the abundant literature on geologic applications
of remotely sensed data and an ongoing series of international
conferences dedicated to the study of lineaments in general, of
which seven have been held since 1974 (eg. Gabrielson, et al.,
1983). Regional and local analyses of photolineaments are now
frequently used as an aid in assessing the tectonic structure and
petroleum potential of frontier basins (eg. Halbouty, 1976, 1980;
Moore and Anderson, 1985), targetting areas for mineral exploration
(eg. Halbouty, 1976), locating zones of enhanced ground water or
natural gas yields (Cooley, 1984; Jammallo, 1983; Rauch, 1984;
Rodgers and Anderson, 1984), defining fractured zones important to
geothermal energy development (Goldstein, 1985), and predicting
fracture trends that might affect induced fracturing of petroleum
reservoirs and enhanced recovery operations (Alplay, 1969; Hagen,

1985; Shumaker, et al., 1976).

Within Kansas and nearby areas, photolineaments have been

37

mapped on aerialphoto mosaics by Stelljes (1964), on radar imagery
by Jefferis (1969), and on Landsat satellite imagery by Anderson
(1981), Callen (1983, 1985), Cooley (1984, 1986), Dwivedi (1983),
McCauley (1988), McCauley and others (1978), Patton and Manwaring
(1984), Peterson (1979), Podwysocki (1974), Proctor and others
(1979), and Toweh (1978), among others. The tectonic implications
of some of these studies are discussed in the Results section below.

Gravity and magnetic lineaments have also generally been considered to reflect possible basement faults, although the literature
on their analysis is not as numerous as for lineaments on topographic maps and remotely sensed images (Lewis and Haeni, 1987). Many
of the basic principles of gravity and magnetic lineament interpretation are given by Dean and others (1984), Gay (1972), Jammallo
(1983), Ossinger (1983), Peterson (1985a, 1985b), and Rasmussen
(1983), to mention a few. Yarger (1983) mapped aeromagnetic lineaments in Kansas (Figure 10) and considered most of these features
(p. 29) to correspond to unmapped intrabasement faults and other
lithologic discontinuities. Lam (1987) mapped a large number of
gravity lineaments in Kansas (Figure 11) and reached similar conclusions (p. 144) regarding their origin. lLength-weighted azimuthal
histograms ("rose diagrams") of Lam’s eastern Kansas gravity lineaments and Yarger’s eastern Kansas aeromagnetic lineaments are presented here (Figures 12A and 12B respectively). On figures 10 and

N.30°E. on each respective rose diagram (Figure 12). Note also a
secondary mode centered on about N.50°W. on each rose diagram that
results from a distinct set of northwest-oriented geophysical lineaments in eastern Kansas. Finally, note a third, much less distinct,
east-west mode occurs in the gravity data and possibly in the aeromagnetic data. In a study of detailed gravity and aeromagnetic data
in southeastern Kansas and adjacent Missouri, Adkins-Heljeson and
others (1988) mapped prominent sets of NW-SE and NE-SW-oriented
lineaments and likewise interpreted them to reflect the structural
grain of the basement there.

Increasingly, multi-source integrated studies have been used to
detect and map natural fracture systems. Such studies often rely on
information sources as diverse as lineament analyses of gravity,
magnetic and remotely sensed data; seismic reflection profiles;
drainage-pattern analysis; oil-field distribution, engineering, and
recovery parameters; geochemical anomalies; earthquake epicenter and
focal plane data; surface and subsurface geologic mapping; and
various borehole studies, such as in-situ stress measurements (see
for example Thumult, 1984; Vixo and Bryan, 1984). Berendsen and
others (1978) conducted such an integrated study for eastern Kansas,
including the present study area, but portrayed their results on
small scale maps, severely limiting their utility for subsequent
detailed analysis at a local level. The present investigation is an
attempt at a similar integrated study using much of the same data,
but with the resultant maps presented at a possibly more useful

final scale.

Drainage Pattern Analysis

Much of the literature on drainage analysis concerns determination of the nature of structural controls on general drainage development, rather than precise locations or orientations of individual
structures that may have influenced particular stream locations or
trends. Most quantitative drainage pattern studies involve measurement of drainage segment orientation frequencies to determine the
degree of uniformity. In areas of flat-lying homogenous strata,
drainage networks tend to display a nearly uniform distribution of
drainage-segment orientations (Morisawa, 1963). Strong deviations
from such uniformity can be interpreted to reflect the influences of
lithology and structural fabric on drainage development (Flarity,
1978; Morisawa, 1985, p. 164; Schick, 1965). In areas of nonuniform
stream orientations where close agreement exists between drainage
orientation modes and dominant structural trends, such as joint,
fault and fold orientations, it is probable that a high degree of
structural control is reflected by the drainage pattern (Cox and
Harrison, 1979; Judson and Andrews, 1955). This relationship is
usually strongest with higher order drainage segments (Delano, 1977;
Flarity, 1978; Jarvis, 1977). It follows then, that in such areas,
there is a good likelihood that a given straight segment of a particular river or stream oriented close to a structural orientation
mode may indicate the actual surface location of such a feature.
Stated another way, an analysis of straight drainage segments (geomorphic lineaments) in an area of nonuniform drainage orientations

could help reveal the surface traces of individual structural fea
43
tures, such as faults, joints and possibly folds, particularly where
they correspond closely to any independent measures of potential

fracture locations.

Soil Gases and Gas Migration

Surprisingly little has been written regarding the occurrence
and interpretation of nonhydrocarbon gases in soils and the subsurface. Helium is perhaps the most commonly reported nonhydrocarbon
gas targetted by soil geochemical surveys. Regional helium soil gas
surveys are generally conducted in an effort to locate oil and gas
fields, uranium and thorium deposits, or geothermal energy fields
(eg. Cunningham, 1987; Cunningham, et al., 1987; Gole and Butt,
1985; Jones and Drozd, 1983; Pogorski and Quirt, 1980). Hydrogen
determinations are occasionally incorporated in soil gas surveys
related to petroleum exploration (eg. Nechayeva, 1968; Rodgers and
Anderson, 1984), but opinions differ on anomaly interpretation.
Sato and others (1984, p. 377) state that site characteristics, such
as local geomorphology and geology, that must be considered in
interpreting anomaly magnitudes. The potential for contamination
from near-surface biogenic sources of hydrogen has also been suggested as a limitation on its utility as an exploration technique (Gole
and Butt, 1985), but the soil-gas work and global hydrogen-budget
models of Conrad and Seiler (1985) indicate that most soils, in
fact, form a sink (not source) for hydrogen, and account for the
annual destruction of up to 95% of the tropospheric hydrogen. Some

hydrogen soil gas anomalies have been shown to correspond with the

4d
surface traces of active faults (Jones and Drozd, 1983, p. 942;

Wakita, et al., 1980; Ware, et

al., 1984) and nondiurnal temporal
fluctuations in soil gas hydrogen concentrations in proximity to
such features have received considerable attention recently as
possible earthquake event predictors (see for example MgGee, et al

—— oa" 3

1983; Satake, et al., 1984; Sato, et al., 1984, 1986; Sugisaki,

1984; Sugisaki, et al., 1983). The precise origin of this "active
fault" hydrogen continues to be debated, but most investigators have
attributed it to either the active shearing of water-rich minerals,
or the release of "pent-up" hydrogen generated by the FeO/hydration
(serpentinization) reaction mentioned above.

Helium and hydrogen, because of their small molecular sizes,
low solubilities in ground water, and low chemical reactivities, are
very mobile gases once generated (Hunt, 1979; McGee, et al., 1983).
They are, therefore, capable of diffusing through all geologic
materials over time, although these diffusion rates are generally
low. Because of this high mobility, they cannot be retained in
traditional geologic traps for long times geologically, and their
presense in deeper subsurface gases (the Heins and Scott wells for
example) implies continuous abiogentic generation at shallow crustal
or deeper levels is taking place (Hunt, 1979; Rodgers and Anderson,
1984, p. 96). Although diffusion rates are generally low, higher
gas-flux rates of several orders of magnitude are predicted for
gases moving upward at depth along faults and fracture zones due to

their fracture-enhanced permeability (Cunningham, et al., 1987, p.

213; Gold and Held, 1987, p. 419; Ware, et al., 1984). High ampli
45

ee ey A el AS 9S 8 AE TT TS

tude, very localized (often single point) helium and hydrogen anomalies detected in soil gas surveys are thus interpreted to reflect
such higher flux rates along near-surface fault zones (Cunninghan,

t al., 1987, p. 213; Driver and Brodine, 1985; Eremeev,

eb ab t al.,

1973; Jones and Drozd 1983; Ovchinnikov, et al., 1972). In addi
tion, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986) reviewed a large number of
subsurface Russian hydrogen occurrences and concluded (p. 126) that
most anomalies occur in association with "zones of deep regional
faults". Angino (1985) pointed out that many of the Kansas soil gas
hydrogen anomalies acquired up until that time (now considered
fairly small) occurred near the centers of river and stream valleys.
McCarthy and others (1986, p. 17) speculated that this association
indicated fault control on the near-surface migration of the Kansas
hydrogen gas. In regional soil gas surveys with sample spacings of
1 to 2 miles (spacings for this study average 0.5 to 1.0 mi.) highly
anomalous values are generally seperated from the statistically less
anomalous background values prior to mapping in order to emphasize
the larger regional trends that may relate to actual petroleum or
other commodity deposit signatures (see for example Cunningham, et
al., 1987). Alternatively, with close enough sample spacing (10-200
feet), the locations of these highly anomalous points can generally
be used to actually map indirectly individual fracture and fault

zones (Roberts and Roen, 1985).

METHODOLOGY

Imagery Analysis

Two general types of remotely sensed imagery were utilized in
this study. These consisted of various Landsat products and lowaltitude airphoto mosaics.

Landsat imagery in three formats was utilized in this study
(Table 1). All images were selected on the basis of minimal cloud
cover conditions, good to excellent image quality, and appropriate
geographic coverage. The band 5 (near infrared) Thematic Mapper
(TM) image dated Jan. 13, 1985 was also selected on the basis of the
superior spatial resolution provided by this sensor and reported
snow-on-ground measurements over the study area. According to the
U.S. Weather Service (verbal comm., 1985) Jan. 10, 1985 snow cover
ranged in thickness from about 44 cm (17 in.) at Concordia in Cloud
County through 30 cm (12 in.) at Milford Lake in Geary County to 20
em (8 in.) at Cottonwood Falls in Chase County. It was felt that
such extensive snow cover and the low sun angle (23 degrees) would
help obscure cultural features and reveal certain, otherwise subtle,
topographic elements (Halbouty, 1976, p. 764; Morrison, 1976). The
band 6 (thermal infrared) TM image dated Aug. 12, 1983 was obtained
because it was felt that the minor drought conditions prevailing
over the study area during the acquisition period would enhance
those areas of anomalous vegetational stress (expressed as leaf
surface temperature) resulting from the increased soil-moisture

conditions expected near lineaments (Berger and Aghassy, 1984; Run

sey, 1971, p. 31-32). ‘The two Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) images were
selected for the high spatial resolution provided by the sensor and
the low sun angle conditions (32 and 44 degrees) during their acquisition dates.

The interpretation procedure for all Landsat image products was
similar to that employed by Anderson (1981, p. 14-19) and Roark
(1985, p. 22-23). A single transparent mylar overlay was attached
to each image and several prominant river junctions or other distinctive landmarks were marked to aid in later registration of all
overlays. Interpreted photolineaments were traced onto these overlays with a "00" Rapidograph ink pen and the aid of a straightedge.
Positive prints were viewed under reflected fluorescent light conditions and transparencies were viewed using the transmitted light of
a commercial fluorescent light table. Viewing was done at both low
and high observation angles in an otherwise darkened room and all
extraneous sources of light were eliminated to reduce eye fatigue.
Various combinations of transparent colored acetate sheets (red,
yellow, green, blue) were utilized to filter both sources of light
(Peterson, 1979, p. 1000). In addition a 79 lines/cm (200
lines/inch) Ronchi ruling was used to aid in the locating of subtle
alignments (Pohn, 1978). Each image was viewed for a period of 10
to 15 minutes (Caran et al., 1981) and reexamined two additional
times on later dates. All linear features were evaluated on airphoto mosaics (see below) to eliminate cultural features. Finally,
all photolineaments observed on two different images, or at least

twice on the same image, were transfered to a final overlay (Plate

49

2) with the aid of an optical enlarging/reducing table.

In addition to photolineaments determined by the above procedure, all linear features mapped in previous Landsat studies overlapping the study area (Callen, 1983; Cooley, 1984; McCauley, et
al., 1978) were reevaluated on the higher resolution imagery available to this study and many of these features also appear on Plate
2. This was done in an attempt to reduce "single-operator bias"
(Podwysocki, et al., 1975; Siegel, 1977).

Black-and-white panchromatic aerial photomosaics of the type
prepared by the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service (ASCS) and its predecessors, the U.S. Commodity Stabilization Service (CSS), the U.S. Production and Marketing Administration
(PMA) and the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA),
acquired between 1938 and 1973, were made available to the author by
the Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Center (KARS), the Remote Sensing
Laboratory (RSL) of the University of Kansas, and the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) for each county of the entire study area. In
spite of some slight inherent geometric distortions, the airphoto
mosaics proved invaluable for evaluating the geomorphic validity
(ie. not cultural effects) and possible geologic causes of Landsatderived features, because these large-scale images were readily
available, and provided both good spectral definition and excellent

spatial resolution (Peterson, 1979, p. 998).

Drainage Analysis

Linear elements of the study area drainage network represent a

50
subset of data derived from an earlier study. Details of the mapping methodology, compilation, and possible interpretations of these
data are available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987). In general,
these data represent a combination of the linear drainage segments
of the study area drainage network as portrayed on the 1,000,000scale U.S. Geological Survey base map of Kansas and the 1:250,000scale U.S. Geological Survey Manhattan and Hutchinson topographic
map sheets. The drainage lines on these maps were originally traced
from aerial photos and are thus portrayed in considerable detail. A
map of these linear segments is not included herein. However, the
drainage network as portrayed on the 1:2500,000-scale maps is available (Plate 2) for comparison with the linear features obtained from

the other data sources.

Gravity Data

Gravity data used in the present study comprise a subset of an
ongoing state-wide gravity survey being conducted by the Kansas
Geological Survey. Within the study area data were acquired by the
Survey over a period of several years using a Worden gravimeter a
stations located every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) or 3.2 km (2.0 mi.) along
east-west transects spaced either 9.6 km (6 mi.) or 6.4 km (4 mi.)
apart respectively (see Lam, 1987, Fig. 6 for actual station locations). These relative gravity measurements were tied into the
International Gravity Standardization Net to establish absolute
gravity values. Earth tide, meter drift, free-air, and Bouguer

corrections were applied using a Bouguer density value of 2.67

51

gm/cm?. Terrain corrections were not performed due to the low
topographic relief of Kansas. Gridding of the data at 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) allowed for spectral domain filtering (see
below) to produce various map products. Estimated overall accuracy
of the final gridded data is thought to be better than 0.5 mgal
(Lam, 1987).

Gravity map products used in this study were produced by digital filtering of an appropriate subset of the Kansas gravity dataset. Filtering operations applied included calculation and removal
of a tenth-order trend surface, as used by Lam (1987, p. 133) to
enhance the contributions of shallow basement sources, and produc
t al.,

tion of two low-angle synthetic illumination images (Yarger,
1984) at "sun" azimuths of 120 degrees (ESE) and 235 degrees (SW) of
north to enhance NNE-trending and NW-trending features respectively
(for state-wide examples of these products see Lam, 1987). The
orientations for these latter two filters were selected on the basis
of two distinct maxima in the orientation plot of Lam’s (1987, Fig.
38) gravity lineaments of eastern Kansas (recompiled: here as Figure
12A). Paper copies and color plots of the resultant images were
plotted at a scale of 1:250,000 using the Kansas Geological Survey's
Versatek plotter and at a scale of 1:1,000,000 with the Survey's
Tektronics color plotter, respectively.

Mylar overlays were then placed over each map and the trends
and lengths of all apparent linear gravity features were traced onto
them. The final map (Plate 3) represents a composite of all linear

features appearing at least twice on these overlays. In addition,

52

“

the linear features of Lam (1987, p. 143, Figure 11 here) were
reevaluated on the study area plots and retraced at the new scale

when considered appropriate.

Aeromagnetic Data

Aeromagnetic data used in this study are part of a high-quality
aeromagnetic survey of the entire state of Kansas completed by the
Kansas Geological Survey between 1975 and 1979. Data were acquired
with an airborne proton-precession magnetometer at a nominal elevation of 762 m (2500 ft.) above sea level along east-west flight
lines with a 3.2 km (2 mi.) spacing and a 2.0 second sample rate.
Resultant measurements were thus spaced about every 0.16 km (0.1
mi.) along track. Data were subsequently regridded to 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) using a nearest neighbor approach and are
believed to be accurate to about 5 nanoteslas (5 gammas). /Yarger
(1981, 1983) gives additional details on acquisition and reduction
of the basic dataset.

The aeromagnetic map products used in the present study were
produced from a subset of the state-wide dataset using existing Fast
Fourier Transform computer routines on the Kansas Geological Survey's Data General computer. Yarger (1981, 1983) utilized the same
algorithms to produce a set of digital images for interpreting the
gross features of the state’s magnetic field. Processing procedures
applied in this study included “reduction to the pole", "downward
continuation", "second vertical derivative", and “synthetic illumi
nation" (for state-wide examples of these products see Yarger,

53


1983). Reduction to the pole is used to remove the effect of the
earth’s inclined magnetic pole and thereby improves the resolution
of anomaly locations. Downward continuation is a mathematical procedure to calculate the magnetic field at a specified elevation
below the original measurement plane and has the effect of enhancing
shallow basement anomalies. Since the rock bodies responsible for
these near-surface anomalies are the ones most likely to have produced structural deformation in the overlying strata, this operation
was applied to the data. Magnetic data were "downward continued" to
2,000 feet below sea level, the approximate average top of the
Precambrian surface in the study area. The second vertical derivative of the magnetic field is often useful for enhancing nearvertical contacts between materials of differing magnetic properties
(Vacquier, et al., 1951) and was therefore thought to be particularly useful for defining possible intra-basement faults in the study
area. The prominent orientations of eastern Kansas linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28) for eastern Kansas (Figure
12B) are strikingly similar to the trends of eastern Kansas gravity
lineaments (Figure 12A) as mapped by Lam (1987, p. 147). Therefore,
synthetic illumination using the same "sun angles" as in the gravity
processing (see above), was used to enhance study area magnetic
features.

A similar set of contour and color plots was again obtained and
a series of mylar overlays were prepared by tracing all lines representing linear magnetic features onto them. The final map of magne
tic lineaments (Plate 3) also represents a composite of linements

54
observed on two or more images. Here again, those linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28, Figure 10 here) in the study
area were also reevaluated and many were retraced onto the final

overlay at the new scale.

Earthquake Foci Data

Data on earthquake and microquake epicenter locations used in
this study (Tables 2 and 3 respectively) were taken from published
sources (DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Steeples, et al., 1987) and recent
unpublished data on file at the Kansas Geological Survey (Greg
Hildebrand, written comm., May 6, 1988). Historic earthquake epicenter data of DuBois and Wilson was originally compiled from written descriptions by earthquake witnesses and damage accounts, and
are presented in Modified Mercalli magnitudes. Because of the
somewhat subjective and imprecise nature of these records, epicenter
locations as plotted (Plate 1) may be subject to considerable locational error. Microquake data has been acquired by a local seismograph network only since 1977 and event magnitudes are recorded in
Richter scale units. Epicenters of these events are located with
greater precision. A discussion of root-mean-squared locational
errors and estimated focal depths is available elsewhere (Steeples,

et al., 1987). Relative to the interpretation of distinct clusters

of epicentral locations (Plate 1), Steeples (1982) has stated (p.
73) that “the trends of microquake activity [in Kansas] define zones

in the basement, where sufficient fault-related permeability might

exist to allow the circulation of fluids from the deep crust."

structural Information

Prior to drafting Plate 4, the author prepared a revised version (not atiown} of Cole’s (1976) and Sims’ (1985) maps of the
Precambrain surface. Well control for this map consisted of about
280 oil and gas tests that penetrated the Precambrian and was taken
primarily from Cole and Watney (1985), with post-1983 data provided
by the University of Kansas, Project Upper Crust (Lanny Lathan,
written comm., May 11, 1988), and the Kansas Geological Survey (Lynn
Watney, written comm., May 13, 1988). In addition to basement
faults mapped by Cole and Sims, the locations of known or suspected
faults mapped in overlying strata (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, Map 6;
Curtis, 1960; Newell, 1987) were extended down to the Precambrain
surface following the assumption of Berendsen and Blair (1986, p. 3)
that "a fault present in a mapped unit must cut the underlying older
rocks as well." On Plate 4 these "probable faults" appear to be
concentrated along the Nemaha uplift because of the fairly high
drilling density there and very limited well control over the remainder of the area. Additionally, linear structural trends on the
revised basement map that could conceivably represent faults were
annotated on this map in much the same fashion as Berendsen and
others (1978, Fig. 3) treated Cole’s (1976) map. Features portrayed
as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4 are thus a composite of
those mapped by Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18, reproduced as
Figure 4 here) and additional basement fractures interpreted in this
study from the above-mentioned basement structure trends, and linea
ments interpreted from geophysical, remotely sensed, drainage, and

58

earthquake foci data (see Discussion section below).

Soil Gas Data

Soil gas measurements used in the present investigation (Plate
1) represent a composite of 190 soil gas hydrogen values obtained by
the U.S. Geological Survey in July, 1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986;
McCauley and Watney, 1984) and an as yet unpublished dataset of just
over 400 measurements acquired since that time by Ernest E. Angino
and coworkers as part of an ongoing study of the Kansas hydrogen
occurrence. Soil gas samples and hydrogen determinations for these
two studies were obtained by different techniques.

The procedure used by the U.S. Geological Survey has been
described in considerable detail by McCarthy and others (1986, p.
9). In general, it consisted of driving a 0.75 m (2.5 ft.) long

(0.3 in?) gas

hollow steel probe in the soil, withdrawing a 5 cm
sample with a syringe, and analyzing it immediately in a truckmounted mass spectrometer. This uncalibrated procedure produced
measurements of relative hydrogen concentration only. Values reported here as "small anomalies" and "medium anomalies" on Plate 4 from
this dataset are those considered "possible anomalies" and "anomalies" by McCauley and Watney (1984, Fig. 5B, 10) on the basis of
degree of positive deviation from their daily (downward) trends.
The very shallow nature of their sampling depth probably produced
considerable diurnal variations in hydrogen concentrations (Gole and

Butt, 1985, p. 2112; Sato, et al., 1986, p. 12,321) which they

apparently did not attempt to account for. The deeper sampling of

59

the Angino group was an attempt to overcome this problem.

The methodology of Angino and coworkers has not been previously
described and is outlined here (Ernest E. Angino, verbal comm., May
27, 1988). Trailer or truck-mounted power soil augers were used to
drill 5 cm (2 in.) diameter holes to average depths of about 3 m (10
ft.) [actual range = 2-4.5 m (6-14 ft.)] at locations on private
lands spaced about every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) [locally 0.8 km (0.5 mi.)]
along sample traverse roads (Plate 1). Holes were cased with conmercially available 5 cm (2 in.) diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipes of an appropriate length. PVC pipes had been slotted on the
lower 60 cm (2 ft.) and were fitted on the top with a septunequipted PVC end cap. Pipes were pumped to partial vacuum and left
undisturbed for a period of about 15 minutes, allowing soil gasses
to collect within the pipes. Gas samples were then withdrawn
through the septa with a 100 cm? (6.0 in.?) syringe and analyzed
immediately in portable gas chromatographs. 269 analyses were performed prior to the 1987 field year and utilized a Hewlett Packard
5890A model gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector
and a 1 meter capillary column. This technique produced only relative measurements of soil gas hydrogen concentrations (sample locations indicated as "Relative Values" on Plate 1). Gas analyses
performed since that time utilized a field-ruggedized, HNU Series
301 model portable gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity
detector and a 4 meter capillary column. Alternate analyses of 100
cm? (6.0 in.) samples of a calibrated gas standard (stated concen
trations of 1000 ppm + 1% Hy, 500 ppm +1% He) during this latter

60

cs

period allowed absolute determinations of 135 hydrogen concentrations to be made (sample locations marked “Absolute Values" on Plate
1). Sdhsequent vesenp ling of some of the older, "relative" stations
empirically demonstrated a nearly linear relationship existed between the two types of measurements.

To facilitate comparison of hydrogen anomaly magnitudes from
these two sources, highly anomalous measurements were grouped into 4
relative classes in an approach that differs slightly from that of
Cunningham and others (1987, p. 218). The population means and
standard deviations of each group ("Relative Values", and "Absolute
Values") were determined seperately (Figure 13), and all values
exceeding the mean for the data type were considered anomalous for
mapping purposes. All measurements below the mean for each data
type were considered to represent a regional "background" population
(although quite high by global standards, see for example Ware, et
al., 1984), and are portrayed on Plate 4 accordingly. Measurements
between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and those greater than 3 standard
deviations above the population mean for each respective group are
portrayed on Plate 4 as "small", "medium", and "large" anomalies
respectively. Interestingly, 32% of the values of each group exceed
the corresponding means and are thus considered anomalous. This may
be an indication that both populations represent statistically valid
samples of a single population in spite of slightly different gas

sampling procedures and analytical techniques.

RESULTS

Drainage Analysis

Analysis of drainage network maps for that portion of Kansas
lying between 38 an 40 degrees north latitude and 96 and 98 degrees
west longitude (including all of the present study area) was completed at an early stage in this investigation and resulted in the
delineation of 644 linear stream segments totaling 6023 km (3743
mi.) in length from all drainage basins exceeding 10 kin? (3.9 mi.)
in area. A more detailed discussion of the results from this analySis is available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987), but, in general,
the correlation of the single broad north-south mode in this data
with known geologic controls was found to be poor. Nonetheless, a
length-weighted azimuthal histogram ("rose diagram") has been compiled in 10 degree increments from the linear drainage segments
mapped during that investigation and is included here (Figure 14B)
for comparison with other linear feature data.

Length-weighted values, as opposed to simple orientation frequencies, were utilized in compiling the drainage rose diagram, and
all subsequent diagrams, because this approach permits direct quantitative comparisons of orientation tendencies for many data types
to be made, regardless of sample size. In addition, correlation
coefficients between linear-feature orientation frequency and cummulative length for each data type are all slightly positive (eg. for
drainage alignments, r = +0.11), indicating that those linear fea
tures possessing the more abundant orientations also tend to be

63

slightly longer. These two factors (length-weighting, and positive
length/frequency correlations) are additive and thus tend to produce
fairly "spikey" rose diagrams. Note also that the radial scales (in
percentage by length) of these diagrams vary from figure to figure
in order to portray the maximum rays of each diagram at approximately similar physical lengths, further facilitating comparison of
the different types of data. During examination of these rose
diagrams, the reader should bear in mind that a truly random distribution of linear element orientations would statistically tend to
produce a rose diagram with all 18 rays of approximately 5.6% in
length (100% / 18 rays = 5.6% / ray).
Imagery Analysis

Analysis of study area Landsat imagery produced a sompogite of
242 straight or nearly straight photolineaments totaling 2132 km
(1325 mi.) in length and 50 distinctly curved photolineaments.
Comparison of these photolineaments with the drainage network (Plate
2) shows that almost all photolineaments of both types correspond to
linear or semicircular drainage features respectively. This finding
concurs with most previous studies reported in the literature.
Given that most of these features correspond with surface drainage
elements, the locations of which are precisely defined, both the
locational accuracy and orientational precision of these features
are considered very good. Some of the strongly curved photolineaments ("curvilineaments" of some other authors) also appear to
correlate with structural domes, horsts, or grabens as mapped by

Berendsen and Blair (1986), and Cole (1976) along the Nemaha anti
65

cline, and, to a lesser degree, with circular aeromagnetic (Yarger,
et al., 1981) or gravity (Yarger, et al., 1985) anomalies. Other
than these general observations, further analysis of the possible
tectonic significance of curved photolineaments was not attempted.

Cursory examination of Plate 2 reveals that two fairly distinct
azimuthal modes are present in the straight photolineament data.
These trends have been quantified with a length-weighted rose diagram (Figure 14A) of their orientations. Because of the obvious
difficulties and dubious value in determining average azimuthal
values for the strongly curved photolineaments, these features have
been excluded from this compilation. One wide, but fairly distinct,
mode occurs at about N.10°E. A less prominant and narrower mode
occurs at about N.40°W. Note that neither of these modal orientations agrees well with any of the well-documented regional joint
trends (N.60-75°E., N.10-35°W., and N.70-83°W.) of the eastern
Kansas-Oklahoma area as discussed above.

This bimodal distribution of study area photolineaments resembles fairly closely the results of Anderson's (1981, Fig. 7b) study
of Landsat photolineaments in an adjoining area of southeastern
Nebraska, although his modes appear to be offset clockwise by about
20 and 10 degrees respectively. In addition, he interpreted (p. 19)
a broad northeastern maximum to represent a composite of two narrower modes. From extensive comparisons with many possible geologic
causes, he concluded that many of the photolineaments could mark the
surface traces of a periodically rejuvinated regional basement frac
ture system.

66

These two prominant modes at N.40°W. and N.30°E., as well as
two less frequent modal orientations of N.15°W. and N.65-70°E., were
also present in the Landsat photolineaments mapped by Dwivedi
(1983). He attributed both sets of photolineaments to a conjugate
fracture system produced by wrench faulting of the Nemaha anticline
and related structures near his study area in south-central Kansas.
Jefferis (1969, Fig. 10A) also documented a nearly identical N.40°W.
mode and a N.50°E. mode in radar photolineaments from southern Douglas County which he ascribed (p. 31) to "major faults and zones of
fracture concentrations." Callen (1983) mapped a large number of
Landsat photolineaments in the Forest City basin and concluded that
at least two individual features in Atchison, Jefferson, and Leavenworth counties, Kansas, reflected two previously unrecognized northeast and northwest-oriented basement faults. He later (1985) used
several basinwide trend surface maps of mean photolineament azimuths
to infer a distinct influence of the Missouri gravity low on the
structural development of the basin.

Orientation statistics have apparently never been compiled for
the remainder of the major photolineament studies in Kansas (Cooley,
1984, 1986; McCauley, 1988; McCauley, et al., 1978; Podwysocki,
1974), but visual examination of each these maps demonstrates that
both the northeast and northwest modes are regionally pervasive.
For example, Cooley (1984) mapped a large number of Landsat photolineaments in western Kansas, and that portion of his map which
overlaps the southwestern corner of the study area is presented here

(Figure 15). Note that, although photolineaments with virtually

every orientation are present, north-northeast and northwest-oriented features are much more abundant and tend to be considerably
longer than the others. Although it is fairly obvious that not
every single one of the photolineaments he mapped corresponds to an
actual geologic or structural feature, it is apparent that a nonrandom componant is certainly present and it does at least seem likely

that it could reflect such a genetic origin.

Gravity and Magnetic Features

Upon initial examination of Plate 3 it is readily apparent that
two prominant orientations also exist for both types of linear
geophysical elements mapped. Compilations of the 71 gravity lineaments totaling 1687 km (1048 mi.) in length , and 94 magnetic lineaments 2560 km (1591 mi.) in cumulative length (Figure 16) appearing
on this map serve to clarify these two prominant modes. These modes
are nearly identical in both orientation and magnitude on both rose
diagrams, and correlate well with the modes determined by Lam (1987)
for gravity and Yarger (1983) for aeromagnetic lineaments in eastern
Kansas (Figure 12). They are also remarkably similar to the modes
determined for photolineaments above. Given the reasonable spatial
resolution of the original aeromagnetic data (see Methodology section), the locational and orientational precisions of the magnetic
features are considered fairly good, although not as good as photolineament data. However, the wide spacing of gravity stations over
most of the study area (see Methodology section) probably degraded

gravity feature locational and, to a lesser extent, orientational

69

od

accuracies considerably.

With closer examination of Plates 2 and 3, it becomes apparent
that the patterns of linear features in the northwestern half of
each map differ somewhat from those present in the southeastern
halves. A more-or-less distinct discontinuity between these patterns appears to correspond with the location of the eastern flank
of the Abilene anticline. Additional rose diagrams have thus been
compiled for Landsat (Figure 17), gravity (Figure 18), and magnetic
(Figure 19) features with respect to whether they have been mapped
northwest of, or southeast of, the Abilene anticline. Although both
of the prominant modes mentioned above are still apparent in both
gravity and magnetic trends, their relative importance is reversed
across the Abilene structure. Northwest-oriented geophysical features predominate in the eastern portion of the maps, whereas northnortheast trending features are considerably more abundant to the
west. This is also true for Landsat photolineaments, but the northnortheast mode has shifted to nearly due north for photolineaments
in the western half of Plate 2. The possible significance of this

shift is not understood.

Basement Structure

The 49 linear features, totaling 1505 km (935 mi.) in length,
mapped on the revised contour map of basement configuration (see
Methodology section) are shown on Plate 3 and their orientations are
compiled on Figure 20A. Again note a prominant mode centered on

N.30-40°E. and a very small secondary mode at about N.50°W.

71

DISCUSSION

Structural Interpretations

In general, with the possible exception of drainage trends,
each of the foregoing compilations of data appears distinctly bimodal, with prominant modes at about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This
close correlation of orientation statistics for linear features
extracted from such widely differing basic data sources [ie. certain
river and stream orientations (linear drainage segments) and areal
spectral reflectance characteristics (Landsat photolineaments),
areal variations in rock magnetic properties (magnetic lineaments)
and rock density (gravity lineaments), and basement surface configuration (linear structural trends)] implies a similar genetic cause.
Comparison of these features with the locations (Plate 4) and orientations (Figure 20B) of the 73 probable study area faults as
previously mapped using subsurface data by Berendsen and Blair
(1986) and Newell (1987) indicates a close correlation exists here
also, again implying a causal relationship. Many of the gravity and
magnetic linear features mapped elsewhere in Kansas are thought to
correspond in both orientation and location with basement discontinuities controlled by faults and anticlines (see Introduction and
Methodology sections above). Therefore, I suggest that the two
prominant modes for linear features in the structural, geophysical,
and remotely sensed data sets of the study area also reflect a
bimodal basement fracture and fault system. Thus, all features por
trayed as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4, with the excep
76

tion those modified after Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18,
presented here as Figure 4 in Introduction section), have been
inferred on the basis of linear features on recorded on Plates 2 and
3. In general, the locations of most of these "possible faults or
fractures" were interpreted from any combination of spatially coincident gravity lineaments, aeromagnetic lineaments, structural lineaments, linear drainage segments, or Landsat photolineaments. Some
were inferred on the basis of aeromagnetic lineaments alone, particularly those oriented either NW or NNE, and a few represent linear
features that correlated well with the extensions of previously
mapped subsurface faults. A discussion of each feature and contributing data sources would be too lengthy to include here, so the
reader is urged to consult the source maps (Plates 2, and 3) for the
following discussion and during evaluation of the interpretative map
(Plate 4).

Many, perhaps most, of the northwest-oriented fractures in the
eastern portion of Plate 4 are probably genetically related to a set
of similarly oriented basement fault zones previously infered to
exist in the granitic basement over much of eastern Kansas and
western Missouri (Berendsen and Blair, 1984; Berendsen, et al.,
1978; Kisvarsanyi, 1974; McCracken, 1971). One of these, the
Bolivar-Mansfield fault zone (Plate 4), appears to intersect the
Nemaha anticline in a structurally complex portion near southeast
Riley County and continues westward through the Abilene anticline
very close to several of the Riley County kimberlites (Berendsen, et

al., 1988, p. 16). These northwest-oriented fractures parallel the

77

~

bounding faults of the Missouri gravity low and it seems possible
that this fault set could represent a Phanerozoic structural event
imposed. on the basement rocks of the region, or could have
originated from tensional fracturing of the upper crust during the
middle? Proterozoic (>1,350 to 1,485 Ma) tectonic event thought to
be responsible for producing the Missouri gravity low. It also
seems possible that the locations and orientations of these faults,
as well as the overall trend of the Missouri gravity low, may
reflect regionally pervasive set of even older crustal weaknesses.
These weaknesses could also have resulted from the roughly dated
(1,800 to 1,400 Ma ?) middle Proterozoic shearing episode discussed
above (see Introduction section), or could conceivably have been
incurred even earlier during early Proterozoic accretion of the
Central Plains province itself (Bickford, et al., 1986, p. 494).
Yarger (1983, p. 27) has stated that most of the northwest-oriented
aeromagnetic features of eastern are interupted at the rift by the
north-northeast features which characterize this zone, implying that
"the northwest grain is older than the rift." Alternatively, the
mechanism which produced the northwest set could postdate formation
of the rift and have simply failed to produce many of these features
within the preexisting rift zone.

Likewise, many of the inferred north-northeast oriented
fractures, so pervasive along the Nemaha anticline and west of the
Abilene anticline, probably correspond with basement fault zones
trending parallel to the Midcontinent rift system axial zone and may

have resulted from tensional stresses associated with middle Proter
78

ozoic (about 1,100 to 950 Ma) formation of this rift, although they
too may reflect earlier crustal anisotropy.

The. north-northeast-oriented fractures show an apparent tendency (Plate 4) to be expressed as zones of fairly closely spaced
fractures (notably the Nemaha and Abilene anticlines, Washington
structure, and possibly the Belleville fault) seperated by wide
areas of relatively unfractured basement. Of these four zones, two
(Nemaha and Belleville) are spatially coincident with abundant historic seismic activity (Plate 1). The former is expressed by over
1,000 m (3,000 ft.) of vertical Phanerozoic fault displacement and
the latter corresponds with the traditionally mapped western limit
of the Rice Formation (Bickford, et al., 1979). The other two
features (Abilene and Washington) have been interpreted as _ the
eastern and western boundaries of rift-related mafic basement rocks
respectively (eg. see Bickford, et al., 1979), and correspond with

both the steepest gradients on the central gravity high of Bouguer

t al., 1985) and distinct discontinuities

gravity maps (eg. Yarger,
on aeromagnetic images of the study area (eg. Yarger, et al., 1981).
In addition, the Abilene anticline was observed (see Results section) to mark the boundary between two distinct areas of linearfeature characteristics, but shows only about 100 m (300 ft.) of
Phanerozoic vertical displacement.

I believe these latter two features (Abilene and Washington)
reflect deep crustal zones that acted as fundamental controls on the

location and structure of the rift zone during extension, including

magma intrusion and extrusion, but are no longer very active tecton
79
ically (as shown structurally and seismically), perhaps because of
"healing" by the extensive rift-related magmatism. The proximity of
the Riley County (Cretaceous age) kimberlites to the Abilene anticline could reflect this deep crustal fracturing. The other two
features (Nemaha and Belleville) could have acted as important
controls on rift-basin and post-rift basement geometry, affecting
the locations of the "east Rice basin" and "west Rice basin", but
were sufficiently distal from active rift magmatism that they have
remained zones of deep crustal weakness through the present.

Taken together these two infered fault sets comprise a well
defined "gridded fault pattern" similar to that proposed for the
northern portion of the Midcontinent rift in Michigan, Minnesota,
and Wisconsin (McSwiggen, et al., 1987; Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985)
and typical of continental rifts in general (Ramberg and Smithson,
1975). This bimodal fracture system could segment the upper crust
of northern Kansas into large orthogonal blocks, as has been suggested for elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Zabawa, 1978). It is
probable, given the relatively thin cover of Phanerozoic sediments
relative to the thick Precambrian crust, that such a pervasive
system of deep fractures (particularly the unhealed rift marginal
sets) could have been periodically reactivated by external tectonic
stresses through time (Ford, 1983). Theoretically at least, the
orientation of any individual fracture plane relative to these
stresses would determine the style of deformation (normal, reverse,
strike-slip, or a combination thereof) associated with any rejuvina
tion event (Peterson, 1985a, 1985b). The complex fault geometries

80

and horst/graben structures presently associated with some of these
fault zones (eg. Humboldt fault zone) may represent near-surface
fault splays resulting from several episodes of convergent wrench
movement along the deeply seated (possibly listric) rift-marginal
master faults (see Wilcox, et al ., 1973, Fig. 15; Zabawa, 1978,
Fig. 27). Episodic reactivation of such zones could also have
produced differential uplift or downdropping of larger crustal
blocks, causing local paleobathymetric and paleotopographic relief
(Gustavson, 1983). Such irregularities might have resulted in important lithologic and structural trends in the overlying Phanerozoic sedimentary package, particularly in water-depth sensitive
near-shore settings (see Introduction section). With adequate constraints on paleostress fields and fracture orientations it might be
possible to predict deformational styles and related lithostratigraphic influences (including petroleum trapping potential) in the
Phanerozoic rocks of the poorly explored, deeper portions of the
Salina basin (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4; Newell, et al., 1988b).
Conversely, in areas of sufficient control, such as along certain
portions of the Nemaha structure, consideration of fault plane
geometries and associated lithotectonic expressions of deformational
styles could perhaps serve to confirm or refute reconstructions of
regional paleostress fields.

The spatial proximity of modern seismicity (Plate 1) to many of
these supposed faults (Humboldt fault zone, Belleville fault, and,
of particular note, the Poersch fault) strongly suggests that move
ment continues along at least some of them at present. Such activi
81

ty could be responsible for propagating these fracture zones upward
to the present land surface, perhaps in the form of zones of more
intense jointing or more rarely as actual faults with stratigraphic
offsets, where they are now expressed as modern drainage alignments
and photolineaments. The overall lack of resistant beds in the
Wellington Formation and the resultant paucity of outcrops over much
of the central portion of the study area (where the largest hydrogen
anomalies occur) precluded evaluation of this hypothesis in the
field using a suitable approach for detecting such zones (for example see Wheeler and Dixon, 1980).

If such intensely jointed zones do exist, however, they could
theoretically provide enhanced permeability pathways for vertically
moving free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. It is also likely
that their ages and tectonic history could have produced different
internal geometries, thereby affecting relative permeabilities
(Schrauf and Evans, 1984). Furthermore, their three dimensional
orientations relative to the modern horizontal stress field should
profoundly influence their fluid conductivity characteristics (Merin
and Moore, 1986). Internal geometry factors (age, genetic origin,
etc.) being equal, those fracture zones oriented subparallel with
the modern principal horizontal stress (ie. approximately eastnortheast) would be expected to be the most "open" to vertically

migrating fluids.

Visual inspection of the locations of linear features (Plates 2

82
~
and 3), infered fractures (Plate 4), and anomolous soil gas samples
(Plate 4) reveals that many of the "medium," "large," and "very
large" hydrogen anomalies occur on, very near, or along the extensions of linear features and suspected fractures. Of particular
note are several anomalies located along the two infered faults
bounding the northern extension of the Lindsborg anticline, numerous
anomalies along the Chapman Creek fracture, and several anomalies
(including the largest “relative" sample of all) located near the
Poersch fault mentioned above. Additional examples could be cited.
Some "small" anomalies also appear to be spatially correlated with
such features. Given the large sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0 mi.),
these findings are somewhat surprising, and suggest a slightly positive correlation may exist between anomaly magnitudes and their
relative proximities to linear features in spite of the coarse sample spacing. However, note that a large number of nonanomalous
values also occur close to linear features. This relationship has
been noted in other studies. Richers and others (1986, Fig. 13)
provided a hypothetical fracture model that can account for these
observations (Figure 21 here). Additional soil-gas sampling at
close intervals (50 to 200 ft.) across one or more of the above
mentioned specific features might serve as a test of the model in
Kansas. Sampling across the trace of a surface fault documented in
Ottawa County (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962) that parallels the inferred
northwest-oriented fracture set, and might help establish the relative importance of actual fault zones as hydrogen conduits (Ware, et

al., 1984) for the Kansas occurrence. Smoothed regional trends of

I believe that the apparent correlation between fracture locations and hydrogen soil-gas anomaly magnitudes, however slight, does
reflect vertical movement of the gas through basement fault and
fracture zones into corresponding (implied, but as yet undocumented)
near-surface fracture zones. Probably the most accurate, and perhaps only, way to verify the existance and nature of these infered
fracture zones, to quantify their various permeability factors, and
determine their relative importance as hydrogen conduits would be to
actually penetrate several of these zones with appropriately located
boreholes utilizing deviated drilling techniques (Figure 22), and
perform relevant core analyses and drillstem tests. Among the particular features to be recomended for such testing at this point are
the inferred Chapman Creek fracture zone, faults flanking the Lindsborg anticline (eg. Salina fault), the Poersch fault, and any other
pronounced anomaly/linear feature combinations detected by additional soil-gas sampling. Assuming such zones were penetrated and
showed evidence of substantially enhanced hydrogen movement, determination of the presence or absence of a reasonably hydrogen-impermeable sealing horizon (salt?, bentonitic shale?) could affect the
potential exploitability of the occurrence. And finally, if the
viability of a hydrogen resource could be demonstrated, additional
reconnaissance-level soil-gas sampling and down-hole testing along

much of the Midcontinent rift system might be warranted.

CONCLUSIONS

Fracture Pattern

The Precambrian basement rocks of the study area are typified
by a bimodally distributed fracture pattern with modal orientations
close to N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This bimodal fracture pattern is
expressed as linear trends in gravity and aeromagnetic data, earthquake foci locations, structural surfaces, kimberlite axes, and as
stratigraphic offsets in seismic data. Surficial indications of it,
such as drainage alignments and spatial variations in spectral
response as detected by Landsat (ie. photolineaments), may reflect
zones of increased near-surface joint intensity over deeper fault
zones.

The northwest-oriented fracture set is apparently the older set
and may date from tensional forces associated with middle(?) Proterozoic formation of the Missouri gravity low or perhaps earlier
accretion of the Central Plains orogen. The north-northeast fracture set probably resulted from axial-parallel normal faulting in
response to tensional stresses during Keewenawan age rifting of the
Midcontinent rift system, but it is also possible that both the
gross rift trend and subsidiary fault locations may also have been
largely controlled by older crustal weaknesses.

This bimodal fracture pattern has been periodically reactivated
differentially throughout Phanerozoic time in response to changes in
crustal stress regimes, due primarily to plate tectonic interactions

at the North American continental margins. This periodic reactiva
86

~

tion is expressed as progressive-displacement-through-time (growth)
faults, fault-proximal Paleozoic lithology and thickness changes,
localized Cretaceous intrusive activity, and modern seismicity. The
styles of movement along particular fractures have changed variously
with geologic time and this is probably a function of fracture plane
orientation and principal stress direction. Nearby tectonic events
(eg. Ouchita orogeny, Laramide orogeny) have produced major local
effects and well-constrained paleostress directions for these events
may permit predictive modeling of resultant deformation styles on
the basis of fracture orientations in areas of poor subsurface control (Salina basin for example). Parallel sets of through-going
fractures (Belleville and Nemaha fault zones) could also have acted
as conjugate shear couples, resulting in local reorientation of the
principal horizontal stress, complicating this interpretation procedure considerably. The origin and tectonic history of a given fracture has probably influenced its internal geometry and intrinsic
permeability characteristics. The modern principal horizontal
stress in the Midcontinent is oriented approximately east-northeastwest-southwest. Fracture-geometry considerations aside, knowledge
of subsurface stress orientations might permit predictions of the
relative "openness" (net permeability) of individual fractures or

fracture sets, such as might affect intrafracture fluid movement.

Soil Gas Relations

Hydrogen detected in soil gases undoubtly originates below the

Phanerozoic-Precambrian interface, perhaps from the active serpenti
87

nization of rift-related mafic rocks, perhaps from deep circulation
and mixing of different formation waters, perhaps from deep-crustal
or mantle outgassing. It almost certainly moves vertically primarily through fractures, either dissolved in formation fluids or as
free gas. The present soil-gas sample density is probably insufficient to delineate, with any degree of certainty, the individual
near-surface fracture zones acting as these possible conduits.
Evaluation of the viability of potential future exploitation of
the hydrogen probably hinges on very accurate delineation of the
major fracture zones through which hydrogen could be moving (not
possible in this study due to inadequate data source resolutions),
the presence of suitable sealing horizons (salt?, bentonitic
shales?), and the use of appropriate well drilling and completion

practices.

Future Research

Suggestions for further research related to the fracture pattern of north-central Kansas, the Midcontinent rift system, and the
Kansas hydrogen occurrences include:

1) Digital processing and reinterpretation of the higher resolution (1 mile by 1 mile nominal station spacing) gravity data
presently being acquired over the study area by the Kansas Geological Survey.

2) Acquisition, enhancement, and interpretation of high resolution, low altitude aeromagnetic data.

3) Installation of additional seismic stations to improve loca
88

tional accuracy and provide a lower event-magnitude detection limit.

4) Acquisition of short, high resolution seismic lines across
the Abilene anticline, Washington structure, or Belleville fault to
determine if Phanerozoic deformation is fault-controlled and the
importance of these structural zones at sub-Phanerozoic levels.

5) Acquisition of closely spaced (50 to 200 feet) soil-gas
hydrogen determinations across those linear features spatially correlated with substantial hydrogen anomalies in the present data set
(eg. Chapman Creek) or known surface faults (eg. Ottawa County) to
test for the presence of inar-sutface enhanced gas-flux effects.

6) Evaluation the possible influence of geomorphic and soil
factors (texture, clay mineralogy, moisture content, etc.) on hydrogen anomaly magnitudes.

7) Determination of hydrogen gas contents of any presently
cased petroleum wells and selected ground water wells in the Clay
County, northern Dickinson County, eastern Ottawa County, and northern Saline County area.

8) Rig-side determination of hydrogen content of gases exsolved
from drilling muds during the drilling of all future petroleum tests
in the vicinity of the Midcontinent rift, both in Kansas and elsewhere along its extent.

9) Targetting of a specific fracture zone for testing, use of
directional drilling to increase probability of fracture intersection, and appropriate core analysis and drill-stem testing.

10) Extension of reconnaissance-level sampling to the north and

west to further define the areal extent of the gas occurrences.

ABSTRACT

Lineament analysis of digitally filtered gravity and aeromagnetic data for that portion of north-central Kansas bounded by
38.5°N. and 40.0°N. latitude and 96.0°W. and 98.0°W. longitude
suggests the basement is characterized by a bimodal set of linear
compositional discontinuities. These discontinuities are interpreted to reflect an intrabasement fracture pattern with modal
orientations of about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. These prefered
orientations are also expressed as linear elements in a revised
contour map of the Precambrian surface configuration, indicating
Phanerozoic movement has taken place along many of them. The northwest-oriented fracture set parallels regional basement fault zones
associated with the Middle Proterozoic(?) Missouri gravity low and
may have resulted from the tensional(?) stresses responsible for
formation of that feature. The north-northeast-oriented set parallels the central axis of the Midcontinent rift system and probably
reflects extensive tensional faulting inferred to have accompanied
the Middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) rifting. Alternatively, both
sets could reflect even older upper-crustal anisotropy. Clustering
of historic earthquake and recent microquake epicenters around
several of these fracture zones demonstrates that some are still
active. Such recurrent seismicity, perhaps in combination with
differential isostatic rebound since Pleistocene glaciation, could
provide a mechanism for upward propagation of these zones.

Although surface faults are virtually unknown from the study

area, correlation between the locations and modal orientations of

the inferred basement fractures and both Landsat photolineaments,
and linear drainage segments, is good to fair. This may imply that
many of these fractures are expressed at the present land surface as
zones of preferential weathering, perhaps in the form of linear
zones of increased joint density.

Comparison between the magnitudes of nearly 600 hydrogen soil
gas measurements and their relative proximity to these suspected
fractures indicates that at least some of these zones may extend to
the present land surface and act as preferential conduits for vertical migration of free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. However,
it is concluded that the present soil-gas sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0
mi.) is too coarse to accurately define the exact surface traces of
these fractures. The viability of future exploitation of the hydrogen is still unknown, but will probably depend on more precise
definition of these zones, the presence of a suitable trapping
mechanism, and drilling and completion practices appropriate for the

occurrence.

INTRODUCTION

Background Information

In 1982, unusually high concentrations of free hydrogen (30 to
40 mole %) and nitrogen (60 to 70 mole %) were detected in casinghead gases of the CFA Oil Co. #1 Scott well in northwest Morris

County, Kansas (Goebel, et al., 1983a; 1983b) and the CFA Oil Co. #1

Heins well (Plate 1) in southern Geary County, Kansas (Goebel, et
al., 1984). Hydrogen was subsequently detected during actual
drilling of several other nearby wells (Goebel, et al., 1985) and
numerous hydrogen anomalies were indicated along two soil-gas sample
traverses (Plate 1) run by the Kansas and U.S. Geological Surveys in
1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986; McCauley and Watney, 1984). Although
the origin of the nitrogen has remained somewhat of an enigma, a
search of the relevant literature revealed a minimum of eight possible mechanisms for generating such anomalously high concentrations

of hydrogen in the subsurface (Angino, et al., 1984). The absence

of appreciable CH, or CO, with the gases is indicative of an abiogenic source for the hydrogen. Isotopic ratios and thermodynamic
calculations yield possible equilibration temperatures around 10
degrees C or lower (somewhat below ambient temperature), implying a
deuturium-depleted gas source. The currently most plausible origins
for the Kansas occurrences include ground-water mixing, mantle outgassing, and the the hydration of FeO-rich minerals (for example
olivine) during serpentinization/deserpentinization of mafic or

ultramafic rocks (Coveny, et al., 1987). Of these theories, the

latter may be favored by the position of the occurrence above the
southern end of the Keweenawan-age Midcontinent rift system (central
North American rift system), known to contain partially serpenti
nized mafic rocks (Berendsen,

t al., 1988), and close proximity to
several known kimberlite plugs (Mansker, et al., 1987). Analyses of
gases exsolved from drilling muds during drilling of the CFA Oil #1
Simpson well (Coveney, et al., 1987, fig. 3), CFA Oil #1 Amthauer
well (Plate 1), and wireline well logs of other nearby wells
(Goebel, 1985) have established a stratigraphic range for the hydrogen extending from soil level to the top of the Precambrian basement, further suggesting an intrabasement source.

Although the maximum areal extent of the occurrence is still
rather poorly defined, soil-gas sampling along extensive traverses
(Plate 1) indicates areas in at least 10 Kansas counties are
involved. The highest levels of hydrogen detected along initial
soil-gas traverses were from near the centers of “unusually
straight" stream valleys and an area of Pleistocene(?) age sand
dunes northwest of Abilene (Angino, 1985). Although Phanerozoic
strata in the area of the gas occurrences are essentially flat
lying, the locations and orientations of many streams and rivers in
eastern Kansas are thought to have been influenced by regional joint
trends (Baehr, 1954; McCauley, et al., 1975), near-surface faults
(DuBois, 1978), and reactivated basement fracture zones (Kirk, 1968:
Berendsen, et al., 1978). This suggests that both the near-surface

concentrations and subsurface movements of the hydrogen may be

strongly fracture controlled. If this is true, then knowledge of

ne Ne A A NR OT

the fracture patterns may provide a fundamental key to understanding
the origin, possible trapping, and potential development of this
resource. Although down-hole gas pressures have so far been quite

low (slightly above 1 atm., Coveney, et al., 1987, p. 42), it is

conceivable that such widespread occurrences of anomalous soil-gas
hydrogen could represent the surface expression of a very significant (if economically extractable) future source of energy and raw
materials. Indeed, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986, p. 120) have

predicted that "in the future the extraction and refining of gases

containing hydrogen will become a separate branch of industry."

Study Objectives

In an attempt to clarify further any relationship between
subsurface fractures and hydrogen gas distribution, an integrated
analysis of geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and remotely sensed
data was undertaken for a large area of north-central Kansas. The
primary objectives of this study as originally stated were: 1) to
determine the fracture pattern of the study area with an emphasis on
remote techniques, 2) to relate fracture types and trends to possible tectonic origin(s) and modern crustal stress regime, 3) to
compare hydrogen soil-gas anomalies with fracture locations, and 4)

to develop a working model for subsurface movement of the hydrogen.

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA

Location and Surficial Geology

The study area comprises that portion of north-central Kansas
lying between 96 and 98 degrees west longitude and 38.5 and 40
degrees north latitude, corresponding to the entire Manhattan and
northern one half of the Hutchinson 1:250,000-scale series U.S.
Geological Survey topographic quadrangle sheets. It covers
approximately 28,500 km” (11,000 mi.) of surface area and includes
all or portions of 25 Kansas counties (Figure 1).

Strata cropping out in the study area range from Late Pennsylvanian through Recent in age (Kansas Geological Survey, 1964).
Late Paleozoic and Cretaceous rocks include a sequence of
interlayered marine carbonates and fine terrigenous clastics. The
Middle Permian age Wellington Formation crops out in the central
portion of the study area. It includes a thick salt sequence, the
Hutchinson Salt Member, in much of the Kansas subsurface (Watney and
Paul, 1980), but this salt has been removed from all except the
southwesternmost part of the study area by surface erosion and
subsurface solution (Plate 1). Deposits of Cenozoic age are of
generally minor importance except for thick alluvial fills in larger
stream valleys and a mantle of Pleistocene glaciofluvial sediments
northeast of the Kansan age glacial terminus (Plate 1). Locally in
northern Dickinson and portions of surrounding counties, sandy areas
and small sand dunes of Quaternary age occur on the uplands (Dunlap,

1977; Jantz and Saffry, 1980; Sloanaker, 1950).

Basement Lithologies and Proterozoic Tectonics

The lithologic and structural characteristics of Precambrian
rocks in north-central Kansas are known only from widely scattered
drill hole samples and regional correlations. Holes penetrating
basement rocks within the study area number only about 280, but most
of these occur in a few areas of higher drilling density (Plate 4)
and very few were drilled more than a few meters (10’s of feet) into
Precambrian rocks (Bickford, et al., 1979, 1981; Denison, et al.,
1984). Among the notable exceptions to this general depth rule are
the Hodgen Oil #1 and #1-4 Finn wells in Marshall County, and the
Texaco USA #1-31 Poersch well in Washington County (Plate 1). The
Finn wells both penetrated over 450 m. (1500 ft.) of Precambrian
rocks, and Poersch well is reported to have penetrated approximately
2600 m. (8,450 ft.) of Precambrian gabbros, basalts, and arkosic
clastics (Berendsen et al., 1988). An extensive discussion of the
units encountered in the Poersch well and their possible interpretation is available from Berendsen and others (1988). Unfortunately,
no additional data are currently available for the Finn wells.

The study area lies within the Central Plains tectonic province
(Figure 2), an early Proterozoic accretionary terrane consisting
predominantly of mesozonal granitoid rocks and gneissic metamorphic
rocks of primarily amphibolite grade facies (Bickford, et al., 1986;
Sims and Peterman, 1986). Because rocks of this province are exposed at the surface only in southeastern Wyoming, it has been defined

primarily on the basis of gross geophysical expression, and the

holes. Most of these samples possess cataclastic textures, suggesting they underwent a period of extensive shearing and deformation
after emplacement. Those samples that have been radiometrically
dated yield early Proterozoic ages ranging from 1,800 to 1,600
million years ago (Ma). Locally within the province a set of anorogenic plutons dated between 1,480 and 1,450 Ma occurs. They yield
nondeformed samples, and thus roughly bracket the timing of the
shearing episode (Denison, et al., 1984, p. (C7). A northwestsoutheast-oriented tectonic grain (Figure 3) that may also reflect
this deformation has been inferred for the terrane in eastern Kansas

and western Missouri (Bickford, et al., 1986; Sims and Peterman,

1986) largely on the basis of geophysical and structural trends.
Farther east in central Missouri, a northwest-southeast-trending
gravity low (the Missouri gravity low) and corresponding set of
structural features (Missouri tectonic zone) has been mapped within
the province that has been variously interpreted as a rifted arm of

a possible "rrr-type" type triple junction (Guinness, et al., 1982;

Kisvarsanyi, 1984), major transcurrent fault (Arvidson, t al

1982), or collisional suture (Bowring, et al., 1988) that apparently
predated a middle Proterozoic (1,485 to 1,350 Ma) epizonal graniterhyolite terrane underlying much of southern Missouri, southern
Kansas, and Oklahoma. Detailed analysis of regional aeromagnetic
data in south-central Kansas by Gay (1986, 1988) suggests that an
more complex history of Proterozoic tectonism than previously

supposed may be recorded in the basement there.

gravity maps (eg. Hildenbrand, et al., 1982) and magnetic maps (eg.
Zietz, 1982) is the Midcontinent geophysical anomaly (MGA). The MGA
corresponds to the middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) age "central
North America rift system" (CNARS) of Ocola and Meyer (1973), also
known as the "Midcontinent rift system". The CNARS extends from
Lake Superior southwest to at least the southern boarder of Kansas
(Figure 2) and may continue into Oklahoma (Yarger, 1983). Basalts
cropping out in the Lake Superior region and sampled in boreholes
into the CNARS farther south yield middle Proterozoic radiometric
ages ranging from 1,250 to 950 Ma (Berendsen, et al., 1988).

The CNARS has generally been interpreted as an "aborted rift,"
but debate continues about the precise plate-tectonic event that
produced this apparent failure (Gordon and Hempton, 1983). The
CNARS cuts obliquely across the previously established Archean and
Proterozoic accretionary margins (Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985) and
this may have been a factor in its "failure." Several apparent
offsets occur along the trend of the CNARS and these have generally
been interpreted as transform faults (Carlson and Treves, 1988;
Chase and Gilmer, 1973), but Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 373)
suggested "the rift system was deflected along preexisting structures" at these locations. This latter interpretation agrees with
Ramberg and Smithson’s (1975) conclusion that rift-related faulting
generally follows preexisting fractures locally and the major trends
of rift zones reflect deep-seated crustal inhomogeneities. One such
offset occurs just north of the study area in southeastern Nebraska

and may correspond with the northwest extension of the older(?)

10
Missouri gravity low mentioned above (Arvidson, et al., 1982).
The study area lies astride the northern Kansas portion of the
CNARS (Figure 2). Early interpretations of the CNARS structure in

Kansas (Coons, 1966; Coons, et al., 1967; Scott, 1969) proposed a

central basalt-cored horst block and two flanking clastic basins.
Deep seismic reflection profiling over the CNARS in 1981 by the
Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) program in
northeastern Kansas (Plate 1) has confirmed its rift nature (Brown,
et al., 1983; Gries, 1984; Serpa, et al., 1984), but according to
their interpretation, the CNARS is now thought to consist of an
asymmetric fault-bounded basin roughly 80 km (50 mi.) wide and upto
8 km (5 mi.) deep. The basin is apparently segmented into several
sub-basins by major east-dipping normal faults and these are now
known to be filled with an interlayered sequence of coeval basalt
(900 to 1100 Ma) and arkosic clastics deposited during the time of
rifting (Berendsen, et al., 1988; Dickas and Mundrey, 1988). This
sequence of clastics, loosely termed the Rice Formation by Scott
(1966), had received considerable attention recently as a possible
commercial hydrocarbon source (Dickas, 1984; Fritz, 1985; Gustavson,
1983; Herman, et al., 1985; Lee and Kerr, 1983, 1984; McCaslin,
1984; Newell, et al., 1988a, p. 3), although initial testing has

been disappointing (Berendsen, et al., 1988). The presence of a

large mafic intrusive body at mid-crustal levels underlying the
central portion of the rift basin is indicated by gravity modelling

(Somanas, 1984) and a low velocity body in the upper mantle is

suggested by teleseismic residuals data (Hahn, 1980; Miller, 1983).

een et aren en a rn hE

Near the Lake Superior area, the rift zone is characterized by
two prominent sets of faults: a set of high-angle flanking faults
striking parallel to the trend of the rift, and a second set of
shorter but more numerous transverse faults striking generally
perpendicular to the trend of the rift and cutting the older set
(see Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985, Fig. 4, p. 370). Although they
were probably originally high-angle normal faults generated during
Keweenawan time by the tensional forces responsible for the rifting
event, some of the flanking faults now possess considerable reverse
stratigraphic throw and must therefore represent subsequent compression of the rift zone. For example, there is an indication on deep
seismic reflection data in southwestern Iowa that substantial Precambrian reverse throw may be present along certain rift-related
faults there (Herman, et al., 1985, p. 25). Reprocessing and interpretation of the Kansas COCORP data has also suggested possible

thrust displacements (Berendsen, et

1., 1988, p. 12) along features

previously supposed to be listric normal faults (Serpa, et al.,

1984). Few of the transverse faults in the outcrop area show this
reverse sense of movement. Because similar sets of "gridded" (axisperpendicular and axis-parallel) faults characterize many rifts
worldwide (Ramberg and Smithson, 1975), it seems reasonable to
assume such a set also typifies the CNARS in the subsurface to the
south and west of the Lake Superior area. In fact, Berendsen and
others (1988, Fig. 18) portray such a gridded fault pattern for a

portion of the CNARS in northernmost Kansas, which includes roughly

the northeastern third of the study area (Figure 4).

Contrary to the statement by Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 376)
that the CNARS shows little evidence of post-Keweenawan reactivation,
the Midcontinent rift in Kansas appears to correspond to an area of
periodic epierogenic deformation and Paleozoic faulting, relatively
abundant modern seismicity and active basement faults, and numerous
kimberlite intrusives (see below). These features, in addition to a
Cambrian age (545 Ma) carbonatite intrusion just north of the study

t al., 1975a, 1975b; Carlson, 1988)

area in Nebraska (Brookins,
attest to the deeply fractured and periodically reactivated nature
of the Midcontinent crust along the CNARS (Nishimori and Powell,

1980, p. 30-39; Sykes, 1978).

Phanerozoic History

In comparison with the Proterozoic, the Phanerozoic depositional history and structure of the study area is relatively well
known. Lower and middle Paleozoic strata preserved in the subsurface of the study area consist predominantly of marine carbonates
and siliciclastics deposited near the margin of the relatively
stable North Kansas basin (Figure 5). During this time period,
plate tectonic interactions at the continental margins produced
generally minor, epeirogenic deformation over portions of the CNARS
in Kansas (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4) and other basementinvolved structures throughout much of the Midcontinent. At least
three such orogenic episodes are recorded in the form of regional

unconformities and thickness trends within the lower and middle

Paleozoic strata of the study area (Willoughby and Berendsen, 1978a,

1978b), and locally as anomalous lithologies (Berendsen and Doveton,
1988). Detailed discussions of the gross regional Paleozoic stratigraphic and structural relations preserved in the study area are
available elsewhere (Lee, 1943, 1956).

Near the close of Mississippian time the collision of the
southern margin of the present North American plate with the South
African plate produced north-northwest-directed principal horizontal
stress, culminating in the Early Pennsylvanian Ouchita orogeny.
Compressive stress was propagated cratonward from the Ouachita orogenic front of northern Arkansas and southern Oklahoma and produced
major uplift along the Humboldt fault zone, Abilene anticline, and
similar structures throughout much of the Midcontinent (Carlson,
1988; Howe, 1988). This Late Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and (7)
Early Permian tectonic episode resulted in the formation of the
Nemaha anticline which subdivided the former North Kansas Basin into
the present day Salina and Forest City basins (Figure 6). This
uplift may have been a result of convergent left-lateral strike-slip
(wrench) faulting along preexisting northeast-trending basement
faults (Blair and Berendsen, 1985, 1988; Davis, 1984; Fenster and
Trapp, 1982; Heyl, 1977; Phipps, 1983). Detailed subsurface studies
indicate the Nemaha anticline/Humboldt fault zone consists of a
complex series of scissor faults, sigmoid anticlines, horst and
graben features, pull-apart basins (Berendsen and Blair, 1986a;
Eccles, 1981; Newell, 1987; Steeples, 1982), en-echelon fault zones
(Fath, 1920, 1921; Foley, 1926), reverse-slip faults (Smith and

Anders, 1951; Steeples and Yarger, 1983), and anastomosing fault

zones (Burchett and Arrigo, 1978), all of which are features
consistent with wrench fault deformation (eg. Harding, 1973; Maxwell
and Wise, 1958; Moody, 1973; Moody and Hill, 1956, 1964; Prucha,

1964; Sylvester, 1982; Wilcox, et al., 1973). Thus, the Humboldt

fault zone within the study area almost certainly represents a riftmarginal fault complex of the CNARS in Kansas that was reactivated
periodically throughout the Paleozoic (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, p.

4; Serpa, et al., 1984; Somanas, 1984; Yarger, 1983, p. 29).

Minor continued uplift along the Nemaha structural trend, and
to a lesser extent the associated Abilene anticline (Figure 7),
through Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian times produced significant bathymetric irregularities which had a pronounced local control
on marginal marine depositional environments and biota (Fisher,
1980; Lorenzen, 1973; Sporleder, 1987; Stewart, 1963, p. 12) as well
as important regional and local effects on overall sequence thicknesses and lithologies (Eccles, 1981; Merriam, 1963, p. 98-101, 107112, 118-119). Similar apparent Pennsylvanian and Permian lithotectonic relationships have been suggested elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Watney and Wilson, 1983), although they may have resulted
in part from passive differential compaction over existing structures (Gentile, 1968, 1979, 1984, p. 36; Steeples and Yarger, 1983).

Mesozoic and Tertiary strata are not present over the uplift
within the study area, having either never been deposited, or else,
deposited and subsequently removed. However, studies of overlapping
relations to the north in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa indicate

the Nemaha anticline was again uplifted during the Cretaceous to

early Tertiary Laramide orogeny (Bunker, 1981; Bunker, et al., 1981;
Carlson, 1988). The presence of numerous Cretaceous-age kimberlite
intrusives in close proximity to the uplift (Plate 1) has also been
cited as evidence for renewed tectonic activity during Laramide time
by Chelikowsky (1972), Fenster and Trapp (1982), and Taylor (1950).
The northwest-southeast orientations of kimberlite outcrops and
their associated magnetic anomalies have been cited as evidence for
emplacement along similarly oriented fractures (Brookins, 1970a,
1970b; Mansker, et al., 1987). Chelikowsky argued on the basis of
these orientations, regional joint trends, and major fault geometries for right-lateral reactivation of the Abilene anticline and
Humboldt fault system in response to east-west directed Laramide
principal horizontal stresses, although the evidence for such an
interpretation is not clearcut (Steeples, 1982, p. 58-59). It does
seem possible that considerable stress could have been transmitted
as far cratonward as north-central Kansas on the basis of Bird's
(1984, Fig. 10) model for Laramide foreland deformation and associated Great Plains crustal thickening. The Chadron-Cambridge arch, a
structurally related uplift of western Nebraska and northern Kansas
(Figure 6), was apparently rejuvenated as recently as the Pliocene
and Pleistocene (Stanley and Wayne, 1972).

Seismic activity has persisted along the CNARS to the present
time as evidenced by historic earthquake epicenter data (Burchett,

et al., 1983; DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Eccles, 1981) and microquake

records (Steeples, et al., 1987). The modern principal horizontal

stress (PHS) is oriented approximately east-northeast/west-southwest

20

throughout much of the Midcontinent according to regional well-bore
breakout data, earthquake fault-plane solutions, and various

measures of in-situ stress (Dart, 1987; Zoback and Zoback, 1980).

Faults and Joints

At present, northern Kansas lies within the Prairie Plains
monocline structural province of the central stable region of the
North American craton (Jewett, 1951). Regional dips of a few meters
per kilometer (about 14 feet per mile) or less (<l degree) to the
west are common, although smaller structures can have important
local effects. Only a few surface faults have been recognized
within the Paleozoic rocks of the study area and all are relatively
small in length and vertical displacement (Bruton, 1958; Eccles,
1981; Hooker, 1956; Underwood and Polson, 1987, 1988). Even fewer
surface faults have been mapped previously within Cretaceous strata
of the study area (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962). The Humboldt fault
zone may reach the surface in Nemaha and northeastern Pottawatomie
counties (Du Bois, 1978; Ratcliff, 1957), but this has been disputed
(Seyrafian, 1977). Published studies of subsurface structure in the
vicinity of study area oil and gas fields suggest basement-involved
faulting has played an important role in localizing many of these
accumulations (Curtis, 1960; Smith and Anders, 1951). Berendsen and
others (1988, p. 4) state that Paleozoic reactivation of study area
basement faults resulted in the formation of many Kansas structures.
This is in accordance with the findings of Merriam (1963, p. 227)

that a close correlation exists between the orientations of 99

21

subsurface anticlines (Figure 8A) and 50 suspected subsurface faults
(Figure 8B) in central and northwestern Kansas. Berendsen and Blair
(1986a) utilized subsurface elevations from 3,794 wells to construct
a series of contour maps for six important Paleozoic horizons in
central Kansas, including approximately the southern fourth of the
study area. They mapped a large number of previously named structural features, as well as many unrecognized structures, including
numerous possible subsurface faults. Their maps also show a close
correlation exists between the locations and orientations of faults
and anticlines in central Kansas.

Although joints are the most common fractures observed in the
outcrops of Kansas, they have received only limited study. Prominent regional joint sets striking N.2-4°E. and N.10-14°W. in the
Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation of Hamilton County were remarked
upon by Bass (1926, p. 80). Although not in Kansas, Melton’s (1929)
early work in Oklahoma deserves mention here. He measured approximately 4,000 joint trends in Pennsylvanian and Lower Permian rocks
at 106 localities in central and southeastern Oklahoma. He determined a dominant set strikes N.37°W., correlating closely with the
strike of faults in the eastern Oklahoma "en echelon" fault belt
(Fath, 1920, 1921, p. 150-155), and a less prominent set strikes
about N.65°E. Neff (1949) compiled a large number of joint orientations for Lower Permian limestones cropping out in each township of
Riley County and determined the existence of a primary set oriented
about N.72°E. and a subsidiary, somewhat variable, set striking

about N.25°W. He postulated that the primary set developed in

response to late Paleozoic northwest-southeast directed tensile
stress, and the secondary set developed differentially in response
to irregularities of local basement structure (i.e. Nemaha and
Abilene anticlines). Nelson (1952) mapped an unstated number of
joint trends in the Permian limestones of Marshall County and determined (p. 31) a major set strikes at N.76°E. and a minor set strikes
at N.15°W. He combined these findings with Neff's (1949) data from
adjacent Riley County in an attempt to determine any influences of
Precambrian basement structures on the surface fracture pattern of
the area. He concluded (p. 54-59) that the joint pattern expressed
at the present land surface reflects an "upward transmission and
progressive rotation" of a much older basement joint pattern.

Wagner (1961) used low-altitude aerial photos to map joint
traces in Upper Pennsylvanian limestones and sandstones over much of
Wilson County and recorded two general groups of N.55°E. and N.35°W.
Stewart (1962) used a similar method to map 10,065 fracture (joint)
traces in northern Cleveland County, central Oklahoma (due south of
Sumner County, Kansas). He demonstrated a prominent set oriented at
about N.49°E. and a secondary mode at about N.24°W. Later Stewart
(1967) recorded 881 joint orientations on outcrops of four Upper
Pennsylvanian limestones of Atchison, Jefferson, Douglas, and Osage
counties. He documented a dominant set of "shear" joints trending
N.60°E., a less common set of tension joints trending N.35°W., and a
third set of short, tight joints trending about N.3°E. Ward (1968)
measured the orientations of 5,777 joints in Upper Pennsylvanian and

Lower Permian limestone outcrops of Butler, Cowley, Greenwood,

24
Chase, and Marion counties. He found two prominent sets with orientations that also average N.60°E. and N.35°W. He stated (p. 21-22)
that no correlation was apparent between the orientations of joints
and underlying faults, the joints were post-Early Permian and preEarly Cretaceous in age, and they may have formed as a result of
northwest-southeast directed horizontal compressive stress generated
during the uplift of the Ouchita Mountains. Jefferis (1969) measured approximately 320 joint orientations in two Upper Pennsylvanian
limestones of southern Douglas County. He found (p. 20, Fig. 9) two
sets of well developed joints trending about N.63°E. and N.41°W, and
a third set of short and tight joints trending about N.2°W. Hagen
(1972, 1985) mapped the surface traces of 2615 joints in Lower
Permian limestones of Osage and Kay counties in north-central Oklahoma (just south of Cowley County, Kansas) as they might relate to
waterflooding success. He found a "remarkably uniform" major set at
N.70°E. and a much less common mean at N.35°W. DuBois (1978) measured the orientations of an unstated number of joints in Lower
Permian limestones of northestern Nemaha County. She found two
pronounced sets oriented at about N.85°E. and N.35W. Macfarlane
(1979) measured about 180 joints in Lower Permian limestones of
northeastern Morris County. He found (his Plate C) a prominent set
at N.45°E. and a less common set at N.52°W. Hoppie (1980) measured
311 joints on 98 outcrops of the Lower Cretaceous Kiowa Shale and
Lower(?) Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone, and 190 joints from 48 exposures of the Upper Cretaceous Greenhorn Limestone in Ottawa, Cloud,

and Mitchell counties. He found (p. 52, Fig. 12) one well-developed

25

set trending N.83°W. in the Greenhorn Limestone, but no distinct
modes were apparent in data for the older clastic units. He concluded that the joints of the Cretaceous rocks of north-central Kansas
were not formed in the same tectonic province as those in the upper
Paleozoic strata of eastern Kansas. Eccles (1981) documented a few
joint trends in Lower Permian Limestones of western Wabaunsee and
eastern Riley counties. He determined (p. 40) means of N.76°E. and
N.12°W. for joints in Wabaunsee County, and (p. 45) means of N.65°E.
and N.21°W. for Riley County sets.

The most recent studies of Kansas joint orientations and their
possible origins are those of Drees (1974) and Neuhauser (1983,
1986). They measured the orientations of 250 joints in the Upper
Cretaceous Fort Hays Limestone Member of Ellis County and determined
a dominant set strikes N.70°W. and a less prominant set strikes
N.25°E. Neuhauser attributed the formation of these two sets to a
conjugate shear couple developed in response to nearly east-west
directed compressive stress of probable early Tertiary (late-Laramide orogeny) age.

A summary of relevant statistics for each of the foregoing
studies is presented in map form on Figure 9. Each symbol represents a single study, and the orientation and length of each ray
corresponds to the orientation and relative abundance of each joint
set measured in a given study. Note the relative consistancy of the
two sets expressed in Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks, and their
distinct discordance with sets in the Cretaceous strata to the west.

Drainage Pattern

The drainage pattern of Kansas and its origin represents an
interesting aspect of Kansas geology that has received rather sporadic attention over the years, but little detailed study. At first
glance, the drainage network over much of Kansas appears to demonstrate a "textbook example" of the basic dendritic pattern expected
for areas of flat-lying rocks of fairly uniform lithology (Howard,
1967). However, on closer inspection (Plate 2) it becomes apparent
that certain orientations are more prevalent than others, producing
a distinctly subdendritic to rectangular drainage pattern. This
deviation from purely dentritic suggests some form of structural
control influenced drainage development in Kansas (Morisawa, 1985,
p. 145).

Early works on the relationships between drainage and structure
in Kansas are qualitative to semiquantitative at best. Bass (1928,
1929, p. 17-23) remarked on the pronounced asymmetry of many Kansas
drainage basins and suggested differential weathering effects due to
topographic aspect, rather than structural or tectonic influences,
were the cause. During his study of regional joint systems, Nelson
(1952) noted the distinctly rectangular nature of the drainage
pattern in Riley and Marshall counties. He stated (p. 47) "probably
more than 75 percent of the streams in Riley County show some joint

control." Melton (1959) determined the relative frequencies of

28
drainage orientations in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma and
found that the most abundant stream trends were strongly correlated
with the solar insolation angle (i.e. oriented preferentially northsouth) and secondarily with regional joint patterns. This solar
influence on drainage was most pronounced in lower order basins,
whereas apparent joint effects were strongest on higher order
streams. This conclusion differs somewhat from the findings of
Baehr (1954) who studied drainage and rock structure in three small
drainage basins in Geary and Riley counties, Kansas. Baehr stated
(p. 57) that bedding and joints acted as the primary controls on
headward migration of gullies and minor tributaries cutting the
thick Permian limestones of his study area. He did not attribute
any components to nongeologic (i.e. solar) effects.

Merriam (1955, p. 82) commented briefly on the obvious angularity of drainage patterns in western Kansas and later (Merriam, 1963,
p. 254) suggested a bedrock fracture control. Kirk (1968) noted a
rectilinear pattern existed for much of the drainage pattern of
eastern Kansas. He correlated the prominent stream trends with
surface fractures, basement faults, earthquake epicenter distribution, geophysical anomaly trends, and the location of surface igneous intrusions, but offered no quantitative data in support. Ward
(1968) remarked (p. 15) on the apparent influence of regional joint
sets on both the overall drainage pattern, and the specific locations of many smaller drainageways. Chelikowsky (1972, p. 7) also
mentioned an "angular pattern" to the drainage network of Riley

County which he attributed to the regional joint pattern, but did

29

not offer any data to support this assertion. Hagen (1972, 1985),
during his study of joints in north-central Oklahoma, noticed that
they had apparently exercised a strong control on drainage orientations. He ascribed a less prominent north-south drainage maximum
(Melton’s “solar insolation effect"?) to bedding control and all
minor orientations to "Precambrian shears." McNaughton (1974;

McCauley, et al., 1975) utilized an optical Fourier transform of

Landsat satellite imagery to define dominant stream trends for
several portions of north-central Kansas. They argued that tectonic
influences had produced zones of weakness in the surface strata
along which streams tended to preferentially downcut. Seyrafian
(1977, p. 35-42) examined some straight stream segments during his
study of the Humboldt fault zone in northeastern Pottawatomie County, and concluded that strike-slip faulting might account for their
locations and orientations, although obvious stratigraphic evidence
for faulting was lacking. Berendsen and others (1978) utilized the
linear trends of major eastern Kansas rivers to define structural
lineaments in the Precambrian basement, although they did not state
exactly why this relationship should be true.

More recently, Hoppie (1980) evaluated statistically the possible geologic influences on the morphology, including orientation, of
the Solomon River in north-central Kansas. He concluded that the
orientation of a portion of the river flowing over the Cretaceous
Greenhorn Limestone may have been determined by a well-developed
joint set in this unit, but elsewhere the evidence was inconclusive.

Merriam and Sorensen (1982, Fig. 2) mapped a set of prominent topo
30
inn HN Ne eS LL LATS NAY Rs RU _

graphic lineaments in Elk, Greenwood, and Chautauqua counties,
Kansas, and suggested (p. 3) that they reflect regional basement
fault-block structures.

Most recently, the author (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987) studied the
orientations of 4426 straight drainage segments at three scales
within a large portion of north-central Kansas (including the entire
present study area) in an attempt to clarify this apparent relationship between structure and drainage. A distinct N.0-10°E. drainage
orientation mode (Melton’s (1959) "solar insolation angle" mode?)
occurs in all areas and at all scales examined. However, a satisfactory mechanism (other than "solar insolation") for producing this
trend is still lacking. Among geologic controls, regional joint
trends were most strongly correlated with drainage in small order
drainage basins and regional fold axes correlated best with river
and major stream orientations. Because very few surface faults have
been mapped in this area (see above), correlation between surface
fault trends and drainage orientations was difficult to assess.
However, the finding of Merriam (1963, p. 227) that the orientations
of regional folds in Kansas are strongly correlated with (controlled
by?) regional subsurface fault trends implies that the angular
orientations of many study area rivers and streams were perhaps
determined by subsurface faults, rather than regional joint sets as
previously supposed. This also agrees with a statement of Berendsen
and Blair (1984; 1986a, p. 11) that many suspected central Kansas
subsurface faults have corresponding drainage and topographic

features.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Fracture Detection

A large number of techniques for detecting the locations and
orientations of subsurface fractures exist. These range from geologic methods, such as direct observation of joints and faults in the
field, to a diverse number of geochemical, geophysical, and remote
sensing methods. The suitability of a given technique to a particular application depends on factors such as geologic setting, allowable costs, time considerations, necessary precision in locating
individual fractures, and availablity of supporting information
(Goldstein, 1985).

Among geologic methods, surface studies of fault and joint
orientations have received considerable attention in the past.
Regional joint trends are easily determined from simple outcrop
measurements. Unfortunately, surface joint trends may not reflect
major fracture patterns at depth, (Ludvigson and McAdams, 1980, p.
13). In addition, such studies often contain severe investigatorinduced biases due to improper selection and sampling of outcrops,
and only rarely include important information such as joint spacing
and character (La Pointe and Hudson, 1985). Field mapping may be
useful in defining the locations of major faults, but minor faults
or those with little stratigraphic displacement are easily missed,
particularly in areas with thick vegetative cover or sparse bedrock
exposures. Likewise, in areas where subsurface control is good,

structure mapping can often accurately resolve many fault locations.

32

tt heer Ne eee sa ce ett arma it

Unfortunately, in areas of widely spaced drill hole data, such as
the Salina Basin area of northern Kansas, even major faults may be
impossible to recognize.

Down-hole studies, such as borehole televiewing and "fracturefinder" type electric logging, can also provide absolute measurements on the locations and orientations of individual fractures, but
must be performed on uncased holes soon after drilling. Similarly,
thin-section studies require the acquisition of oriented cores
during drilling. All down-hole methods suffer from very limited
areal resolution.

Among surface geophysical approaches to fracture detection,
potential-field methods such as gravity and magnetic mapping have
received only limited use, primarily because they tend to reveal
only intrabasement discontinuities and lack the ability to resolve
precisely the locations of individual fractures (Lewis and Haeni,
1987). Electromagnetic methods such as earth resistivity and Very
Low Frequency (VLF) radiowave surveys have been used to detect
subsurface fractures with varying success (Anderson, 1981; Crumpton
and Badgley, 1959; Steele, 1982), but are time-consuming and of
limited applicablity. In regions with fairly high levels of seismicity, for example southern California and Missouri's New Madrid
area, plotting accurately-located earthquake epicenters may produce
alignments that can be related to fracture locations with some
certainty. One of the more widely used methods for mapping natural
fracture systems is high-resolution reflection seismic data (Till
man, 1983, p. 165). Unfortunately, seismic studies suffer from

33
fairly high acquisition and processing costs and the inability to
resolve fractures along which little or no vertical movement has

occured (Aguilera, 1980).

Lineament Analysis

One of the most widely used and almost universally accepted
approaches to mapping fracture locations and orientations is lineament analysis of topographic maps, potential-field geophysical data,
and remotely sensed imagery. In spite of this widespread acceptance
and use, the terminology of lineament analysis is little agreed upon
and has undergone many changes since the time Hobbs (1904, 1911)
first described linear topographic alignments in the landscape of
the northeastern United States. In this paper I will follow the
general definition of a lineament as set forth by Caran and others
(1981) as "a figure that is perceived in an image or other factual
representation of a solid planetary body that is linear and continuous, has definable end points and lateral boundaries, has a relatively high length to width ratio, a descernable azimuth, and is
shown or presumed to correlate with planetary elements whose origin
is geologically controlled." Under this definition, any linear
features perceived on topographic maps, visible or infrared spectral
data (eg. aerialphotos or Landsat satellite images) or any linear
discontinuities on potential-field geophysical data can be termed
lineaments. To reduce confusion somewhat, linear topographic features (including linear stream segments) could be termed “geomorphic

lineaments", linear spectral features could be termed "photolinea
34

ments", and those apparent on geophysical data could be termed
"geophysical lineaments", or more specifically, "gravity lineaments"
and "magnetic lineaments". This is the specific usage followed
herein.

Since the time of Hobbs (1904, 1911) early papers on the subject, geomorphic lineaments and various types of photolineaments
have probably received the most attention as possible indicators of
subsurface fractures (eg. Caran, et al., 1981; Gilluly, 1977; Haman,
1961, 1964). Readily apparent on virtually any topographic map,
aerial photo, or space image of almost any earth terrain (Gay, 1973,
appendix 2), both types lineaments have generally been considered
the surface traces of subsurface fractures of various types. Unfortunately, in many early lineament studies the precise geologic
origin of these lineaments was not addressed or was stated as "unclear". Lineaments were simply mapped and a structural connotation
was assumed with little substantiating data (Anderson, 1981, p. 1).
The apparently limited value of these early investigations (Gilluly,
1977) probably resulted from inadequate study documentation, inconsistent mapping methods, and indiscriminate use of terms such as
"lineation," "lineament," "“photolinear," “linear feature," "“alignment," and "fracture trace," (Caran, et al., 1981; O’Leary and
Friedman, 1978; O'Leary, et al., 1976a, 1976b). Some researchers
could demonstrate good agreement between the trends of shorter
lineaments and the orientations of major (regional) joint sets (eg.

Boyer and McQueen, 1964; Brown, 1961; Dean, et al

— <a ?

1985; Loar,

1985), which strongly suggested a genetic relationship. In other

35

studies a particular linear feature was shown to correspond to a
zone of more intense jointing in the underlying strata (Lattman and
Matzke, 1961) and less often to mappable surface faults (Brown,
1961; Elifrits, 1982; Jefferis, 1969). The largest of linear
features were generally correlated with suspected basement faults
(eg. Dean, et al., 1984; Hughes, 1983; Lattman, 1958; Maughan and
Perry, 1983) and sub-continental sized fracture zones (Wise, 1969).
Salisbury and Merriam (1984) showed that the major Landsat
photolineament orientations present in an area of southeastern Canada and New York with outcropping Precambrian crystalline basement
rocks were also present in adjacent areas where the basement was
overlain by thick lower Paleozoic strata. They suggested that the
tectonic forces responsible for creating these lineaments in both
areas either: 1) post-date the sediments altogether, or 2) that some
other mechanism caused existing pre-Paleozoic lineaments to promulgate upward from the basement subsequent to deposition of the sediments. They favored the latter interpretation. Elsewhere, studies
in terrains covered by Pleistocene glacial deposits and other unconsolidated sediments have indicated bedrock fractures are also represented by corresponding fractures in the overlying deposits and as
photolineaments on images of these areas (DuBois, 1978; Mollard,
1958; Rumsey, 1971; Thumult, 1984). Among the mechanisms that have
been suggested for producing such a upward propagation and surface
expression of deeper fractures are earth tides, earthquakes and
microquakes, plate tectonic compressional and tensional stresses,

earth rotational stresses, and recurrent glacial loading and unload
36
ing (Rumsey, 1971, p. 30-32), and ground-water related processes
(Berger and Aghassy, 1984). Inasmuch as the northeastern portion of
the study area was glaciated during the Pleistocene (Plate 1) and
locations of surface springs and seeps over much of the study area
are probably controlled by near-surface bedrock joints (Donald Whittemore, verbal comm., June 1988), these latter two factors may be
particularly relevant to the present investigation.

Regardless of their precise geologic origin, photolineaments
are now routinely used by geologists for both reconnaissance- level
and detailed structural analysis throughout the world. This is
evidenced by both the abundant literature on geologic applications
of remotely sensed data and an ongoing series of international
conferences dedicated to the study of lineaments in general, of
which seven have been held since 1974 (eg. Gabrielson, et al.,
1983). Regional and local analyses of photolineaments are now
frequently used as an aid in assessing the tectonic structure and
petroleum potential of frontier basins (eg. Halbouty, 1976, 1980;
Moore and Anderson, 1985), targetting areas for mineral exploration
(eg. Halbouty, 1976), locating zones of enhanced ground water or
natural gas yields (Cooley, 1984; Jammallo, 1983; Rauch, 1984;
Rodgers and Anderson, 1984), defining fractured zones important to
geothermal energy development (Goldstein, 1985), and predicting
fracture trends that might affect induced fracturing of petroleum
reservoirs and enhanced recovery operations (Alplay, 1969; Hagen,

1985; Shumaker, et al., 1976).

Within Kansas and nearby areas, photolineaments have been

37

mapped on aerialphoto mosaics by Stelljes (1964), on radar imagery
by Jefferis (1969), and on Landsat satellite imagery by Anderson
(1981), Callen (1983, 1985), Cooley (1984, 1986), Dwivedi (1983),
McCauley (1988), McCauley and others (1978), Patton and Manwaring
(1984), Peterson (1979), Podwysocki (1974), Proctor and others
(1979), and Toweh (1978), among others. The tectonic implications
of some of these studies are discussed in the Results section below.

Gravity and magnetic lineaments have also generally been considered to reflect possible basement faults, although the literature
on their analysis is not as numerous as for lineaments on topographic maps and remotely sensed images (Lewis and Haeni, 1987). Many
of the basic principles of gravity and magnetic lineament interpretation are given by Dean and others (1984), Gay (1972), Jammallo
(1983), Ossinger (1983), Peterson (1985a, 1985b), and Rasmussen
(1983), to mention a few. Yarger (1983) mapped aeromagnetic lineaments in Kansas (Figure 10) and considered most of these features
(p. 29) to correspond to unmapped intrabasement faults and other
lithologic discontinuities. Lam (1987) mapped a large number of
gravity lineaments in Kansas (Figure 11) and reached similar conclusions (p. 144) regarding their origin. lLength-weighted azimuthal
histograms ("rose diagrams") of Lam’s eastern Kansas gravity lineaments and Yarger’s eastern Kansas aeromagnetic lineaments are presented here (Figures 12A and 12B respectively). On figures 10 and
11 note a very prominant set of north-northeast-oriented lineaments
in central Kansas (corresponding with the trace of the Midcontinent

rift through Kansas) that produces a distinct mode centered on about

N.30°E. on each respective rose diagram (Figure 12). Note also a
secondary mode centered on about N.50°W. on each rose diagram that
results from a distinct set of northwest-oriented geophysical lineaments in eastern Kansas. Finally, note a third, much less distinct,
east-west mode occurs in the gravity data and possibly in the aeromagnetic data. In a study of detailed gravity and aeromagnetic data
in southeastern Kansas and adjacent Missouri, Adkins-Heljeson and
others (1988) mapped prominent sets of NW-SE and NE-SW-oriented
lineaments and likewise interpreted them to reflect the structural
grain of the basement there.

Increasingly, multi-source integrated studies have been used to
detect and map natural fracture systems. Such studies often rely on
information sources as diverse as lineament analyses of gravity,
magnetic and remotely sensed data; seismic reflection profiles;
drainage-pattern analysis; oil-field distribution, engineering, and
recovery parameters; geochemical anomalies; earthquake epicenter and
focal plane data; surface and subsurface geologic mapping; and
various borehole studies, such as in-situ stress measurements (see
for example Thumult, 1984; Vixo and Bryan, 1984). Berendsen and
others (1978) conducted such an integrated study for eastern Kansas,
including the present study area, but portrayed their results on
small scale maps, severely limiting their utility for subsequent
detailed analysis at a local level. The present investigation is an
attempt at a similar integrated study using much of the same data,
but with the resultant maps presented at a possibly more useful

final scale.

42
Drainage Pattern Analysis

Much of the literature on drainage analysis concerns determination of the nature of structural controls on general drainage development, rather than precise locations or orientations of individual
structures that may have influenced particular stream locations or
trends. Most quantitative drainage pattern studies involve measurement of drainage segment orientation frequencies to determine the
degree of uniformity. In areas of flat-lying homogenous strata,
drainage networks tend to display a nearly uniform distribution of
drainage-segment orientations (Morisawa, 1963). Strong deviations
from such uniformity can be interpreted to reflect the influences of
lithology and structural fabric on drainage development (Flarity,
1978; Morisawa, 1985, p. 164; Schick, 1965). In areas of nonuniform
stream orientations where close agreement exists between drainage
orientation modes and dominant structural trends, such as joint,
fault and fold orientations, it is probable that a high degree of
structural control is reflected by the drainage pattern (Cox and
Harrison, 1979; Judson and Andrews, 1955). This relationship is
usually strongest with higher order drainage segments (Delano, 1977;
Flarity, 1978; Jarvis, 1977). It follows then, that in such areas,
there is a good likelihood that a given straight segment of a particular river or stream oriented close to a structural orientation
mode may indicate the actual surface location of such a feature.
Stated another way, an analysis of straight drainage segments (geomorphic lineaments) in an area of nonuniform drainage orientations

could help reveal the surface traces of individual structural fea
43
tures, such as faults, joints and possibly folds, particularly where
they correspond closely to any independent measures of potential

fracture locations.

Soil Gases and Gas Migration

Surprisingly little has been written regarding the occurrence
and interpretation of nonhydrocarbon gases in soils and the subsurface. Helium is perhaps the most commonly reported nonhydrocarbon
gas targetted by soil geochemical surveys. Regional helium soil gas
surveys are generally conducted in an effort to locate oil and gas
fields, uranium and thorium deposits, or geothermal energy fields
(eg. Cunningham, 1987; Cunningham, et al., 1987; Gole and Butt,
1985; Jones and Drozd, 1983; Pogorski and Quirt, 1980). Hydrogen
determinations are occasionally incorporated in soil gas surveys
related to petroleum exploration (eg. Nechayeva, 1968; Rodgers and
Anderson, 1984), but opinions differ on anomaly interpretation.
Sato and others (1984, p. 377) state that site characteristics, such
as local geomorphology and geology, that must be considered in
interpreting anomaly magnitudes. The potential for contamination
from near-surface biogenic sources of hydrogen has also been suggested as a limitation on its utility as an exploration technique (Gole
and Butt, 1985), but the soil-gas work and global hydrogen-budget
models of Conrad and Seiler (1985) indicate that most soils, in
fact, form a sink (not source) for hydrogen, and account for the
annual destruction of up to 95% of the tropospheric hydrogen. Some

hydrogen soil gas anomalies have been shown to correspond with the

4d
surface traces of active faults (Jones and Drozd, 1983, p. 942;

Wakita, et al., 1980; Ware, et

al., 1984) and nondiurnal temporal
fluctuations in soil gas hydrogen concentrations in proximity to
such features have received considerable attention recently as
possible earthquake event predictors (see for example MgGee, et al

—— oa" 3

1983; Satake, et al., 1984; Sato, et al., 1984, 1986; Sugisaki,

1984; Sugisaki, et al., 1983). The precise origin of this "active
fault" hydrogen continues to be debated, but most investigators have
attributed it to either the active shearing of water-rich minerals,
or the release of "pent-up" hydrogen generated by the FeO/hydration
(serpentinization) reaction mentioned above.

Helium and hydrogen, because of their small molecular sizes,
low solubilities in ground water, and low chemical reactivities, are
very mobile gases once generated (Hunt, 1979; McGee, et al., 1983).
They are, therefore, capable of diffusing through all geologic
materials over time, although these diffusion rates are generally
low. Because of this high mobility, they cannot be retained in
traditional geologic traps for long times geologically, and their
presense in deeper subsurface gases (the Heins and Scott wells for
example) implies continuous abiogentic generation at shallow crustal
or deeper levels is taking place (Hunt, 1979; Rodgers and Anderson,
1984, p. 96). Although diffusion rates are generally low, higher
gas-flux rates of several orders of magnitude are predicted for
gases moving upward at depth along faults and fracture zones due to

their fracture-enhanced permeability (Cunningham, et al., 1987, p.

213; Gold and Held, 1987, p. 419; Ware, et al., 1984). High ampli
45

ee ey A el AS 9S 8 AE TT TS

tude, very localized (often single point) helium and hydrogen anomalies detected in soil gas surveys are thus interpreted to reflect
such higher flux rates along near-surface fault zones (Cunninghan,

t al., 1987, p. 213; Driver and Brodine, 1985; Eremeev,

eb ab t al.,

1973; Jones and Drozd 1983; Ovchinnikov, et al., 1972). In addi
tion, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986) reviewed a large number of
subsurface Russian hydrogen occurrences and concluded (p. 126) that
most anomalies occur in association with "zones of deep regional
faults". Angino (1985) pointed out that many of the Kansas soil gas
hydrogen anomalies acquired up until that time (now considered
fairly small) occurred near the centers of river and stream valleys.
McCarthy and others (1986, p. 17) speculated that this association
indicated fault control on the near-surface migration of the Kansas
hydrogen gas. In regional soil gas surveys with sample spacings of
1 to 2 miles (spacings for this study average 0.5 to 1.0 mi.) highly
anomalous values are generally seperated from the statistically less
anomalous background values prior to mapping in order to emphasize
the larger regional trends that may relate to actual petroleum or
other commodity deposit signatures (see for example Cunningham, et
al., 1987). Alternatively, with close enough sample spacing (10-200
feet), the locations of these highly anomalous points can generally
be used to actually map indirectly individual fracture and fault

zones (Roberts and Roen, 1985).

METHODOLOGY

Imagery Analysis

Two general types of remotely sensed imagery were utilized in
this study. These consisted of various Landsat products and lowaltitude airphoto mosaics.

Landsat imagery in three formats was utilized in this study
(Table 1). All images were selected on the basis of minimal cloud
cover conditions, good to excellent image quality, and appropriate
geographic coverage. The band 5 (near infrared) Thematic Mapper
(TM) image dated Jan. 13, 1985 was also selected on the basis of the
superior spatial resolution provided by this sensor and reported
snow-on-ground measurements over the study area. According to the
U.S. Weather Service (verbal comm., 1985) Jan. 10, 1985 snow cover
ranged in thickness from about 44 cm (17 in.) at Concordia in Cloud
County through 30 cm (12 in.) at Milford Lake in Geary County to 20
em (8 in.) at Cottonwood Falls in Chase County. It was felt that
such extensive snow cover and the low sun angle (23 degrees) would
help obscure cultural features and reveal certain, otherwise subtle,
topographic elements (Halbouty, 1976, p. 764; Morrison, 1976). The
band 6 (thermal infrared) TM image dated Aug. 12, 1983 was obtained
because it was felt that the minor drought conditions prevailing
over the study area during the acquisition period would enhance
those areas of anomalous vegetational stress (expressed as leaf
surface temperature) resulting from the increased soil-moisture

conditions expected near lineaments (Berger and Aghassy, 1984; Run

sey, 1971, p. 31-32). ‘The two Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) images were
selected for the high spatial resolution provided by the sensor and
the low sun angle conditions (32 and 44 degrees) during their acquisition dates.

The interpretation procedure for all Landsat image products was
similar to that employed by Anderson (1981, p. 14-19) and Roark
(1985, p. 22-23). A single transparent mylar overlay was attached
to each image and several prominant river junctions or other distinctive landmarks were marked to aid in later registration of all
overlays. Interpreted photolineaments were traced onto these overlays with a "00" Rapidograph ink pen and the aid of a straightedge.
Positive prints were viewed under reflected fluorescent light conditions and transparencies were viewed using the transmitted light of
a commercial fluorescent light table. Viewing was done at both low
and high observation angles in an otherwise darkened room and all
extraneous sources of light were eliminated to reduce eye fatigue.
Various combinations of transparent colored acetate sheets (red,
yellow, green, blue) were utilized to filter both sources of light
(Peterson, 1979, p. 1000). In addition a 79 lines/cm (200
lines/inch) Ronchi ruling was used to aid in the locating of subtle
alignments (Pohn, 1978). Each image was viewed for a period of 10
to 15 minutes (Caran et al., 1981) and reexamined two additional
times on later dates. All linear features were evaluated on airphoto mosaics (see below) to eliminate cultural features. Finally,
all photolineaments observed on two different images, or at least

twice on the same image, were transfered to a final overlay (Plate

49

2) with the aid of an optical enlarging/reducing table.

In addition to photolineaments determined by the above procedure, all linear features mapped in previous Landsat studies overlapping the study area (Callen, 1983; Cooley, 1984; McCauley, et
al., 1978) were reevaluated on the higher resolution imagery available to this study and many of these features also appear on Plate
2. This was done in an attempt to reduce "single-operator bias"
(Podwysocki, et al., 1975; Siegel, 1977).

Black-and-white panchromatic aerial photomosaics of the type
prepared by the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service (ASCS) and its predecessors, the U.S. Commodity Stabilization Service (CSS), the U.S. Production and Marketing Administration
(PMA) and the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA),
acquired between 1938 and 1973, were made available to the author by
the Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Center (KARS), the Remote Sensing
Laboratory (RSL) of the University of Kansas, and the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) for each county of the entire study area. In
spite of some slight inherent geometric distortions, the airphoto
mosaics proved invaluable for evaluating the geomorphic validity
(ie. not cultural effects) and possible geologic causes of Landsatderived features, because these large-scale images were readily
available, and provided both good spectral definition and excellent

spatial resolution (Peterson, 1979, p. 998).

Drainage Analysis

Linear elements of the study area drainage network represent a

50
subset of data derived from an earlier study. Details of the mapping methodology, compilation, and possible interpretations of these
data are available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987). In general,
these data represent a combination of the linear drainage segments
of the study area drainage network as portrayed on the 1,000,000scale U.S. Geological Survey base map of Kansas and the 1:250,000scale U.S. Geological Survey Manhattan and Hutchinson topographic
map sheets. The drainage lines on these maps were originally traced
from aerial photos and are thus portrayed in considerable detail. A
map of these linear segments is not included herein. However, the
drainage network as portrayed on the 1:2500,000-scale maps is available (Plate 2) for comparison with the linear features obtained from

the other data sources.

Gravity Data

Gravity data used in the present study comprise a subset of an
ongoing state-wide gravity survey being conducted by the Kansas
Geological Survey. Within the study area data were acquired by the
Survey over a period of several years using a Worden gravimeter a
stations located every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) or 3.2 km (2.0 mi.) along
east-west transects spaced either 9.6 km (6 mi.) or 6.4 km (4 mi.)
apart respectively (see Lam, 1987, Fig. 6 for actual station locations). These relative gravity measurements were tied into the
International Gravity Standardization Net to establish absolute
gravity values. Earth tide, meter drift, free-air, and Bouguer

corrections were applied using a Bouguer density value of 2.67

51

gm/cm?. Terrain corrections were not performed due to the low
topographic relief of Kansas. Gridding of the data at 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) allowed for spectral domain filtering (see
below) to produce various map products. Estimated overall accuracy
of the final gridded data is thought to be better than 0.5 mgal
(Lam, 1987).

Gravity map products used in this study were produced by digital filtering of an appropriate subset of the Kansas gravity dataset. Filtering operations applied included calculation and removal
of a tenth-order trend surface, as used by Lam (1987, p. 133) to
enhance the contributions of shallow basement sources, and produc
t al.,

tion of two low-angle synthetic illumination images (Yarger,
1984) at "sun" azimuths of 120 degrees (ESE) and 235 degrees (SW) of
north to enhance NNE-trending and NW-trending features respectively
(for state-wide examples of these products see Lam, 1987). The
orientations for these latter two filters were selected on the basis
of two distinct maxima in the orientation plot of Lam’s (1987, Fig.
38) gravity lineaments of eastern Kansas (recompiled: here as Figure
12A). Paper copies and color plots of the resultant images were
plotted at a scale of 1:250,000 using the Kansas Geological Survey's
Versatek plotter and at a scale of 1:1,000,000 with the Survey's
Tektronics color plotter, respectively.

Mylar overlays were then placed over each map and the trends
and lengths of all apparent linear gravity features were traced onto
them. The final map (Plate 3) represents a composite of all linear

features appearing at least twice on these overlays. In addition,

52

“

the linear features of Lam (1987, p. 143, Figure 11 here) were
reevaluated on the study area plots and retraced at the new scale

when considered appropriate.

Aeromagnetic Data

Aeromagnetic data used in this study are part of a high-quality
aeromagnetic survey of the entire state of Kansas completed by the
Kansas Geological Survey between 1975 and 1979. Data were acquired
with an airborne proton-precession magnetometer at a nominal elevation of 762 m (2500 ft.) above sea level along east-west flight
lines with a 3.2 km (2 mi.) spacing and a 2.0 second sample rate.
Resultant measurements were thus spaced about every 0.16 km (0.1
mi.) along track. Data were subsequently regridded to 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) using a nearest neighbor approach and are
believed to be accurate to about 5 nanoteslas (5 gammas). /Yarger
(1981, 1983) gives additional details on acquisition and reduction
of the basic dataset.

The aeromagnetic map products used in the present study were
produced from a subset of the state-wide dataset using existing Fast
Fourier Transform computer routines on the Kansas Geological Survey's Data General computer. Yarger (1981, 1983) utilized the same
algorithms to produce a set of digital images for interpreting the
gross features of the state’s magnetic field. Processing procedures
applied in this study included “reduction to the pole", "downward
continuation", "second vertical derivative", and “synthetic illumi
nation" (for state-wide examples of these products see Yarger,

53


1983). Reduction to the pole is used to remove the effect of the
earth’s inclined magnetic pole and thereby improves the resolution
of anomaly locations. Downward continuation is a mathematical procedure to calculate the magnetic field at a specified elevation
below the original measurement plane and has the effect of enhancing
shallow basement anomalies. Since the rock bodies responsible for
these near-surface anomalies are the ones most likely to have produced structural deformation in the overlying strata, this operation
was applied to the data. Magnetic data were "downward continued" to
2,000 feet below sea level, the approximate average top of the
Precambrian surface in the study area. The second vertical derivative of the magnetic field is often useful for enhancing nearvertical contacts between materials of differing magnetic properties
(Vacquier, et al., 1951) and was therefore thought to be particularly useful for defining possible intra-basement faults in the study
area. The prominent orientations of eastern Kansas linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28) for eastern Kansas (Figure
12B) are strikingly similar to the trends of eastern Kansas gravity
lineaments (Figure 12A) as mapped by Lam (1987, p. 147). Therefore,
synthetic illumination using the same "sun angles" as in the gravity
processing (see above), was used to enhance study area magnetic
features.

A similar set of contour and color plots was again obtained and
a series of mylar overlays were prepared by tracing all lines representing linear magnetic features onto them. The final map of magne
tic lineaments (Plate 3) also represents a composite of linements

54
observed on two or more images. Here again, those linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28, Figure 10 here) in the study
area were also reevaluated and many were retraced onto the final

overlay at the new scale.

Earthquake Foci Data

Data on earthquake and microquake epicenter locations used in
this study (Tables 2 and 3 respectively) were taken from published
sources (DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Steeples, et al., 1987) and recent
unpublished data on file at the Kansas Geological Survey (Greg
Hildebrand, written comm., May 6, 1988). Historic earthquake epicenter data of DuBois and Wilson was originally compiled from written descriptions by earthquake witnesses and damage accounts, and
are presented in Modified Mercalli magnitudes. Because of the
somewhat subjective and imprecise nature of these records, epicenter
locations as plotted (Plate 1) may be subject to considerable locational error. Microquake data has been acquired by a local seismograph network only since 1977 and event magnitudes are recorded in
Richter scale units. Epicenters of these events are located with
greater precision. A discussion of root-mean-squared locational
errors and estimated focal depths is available elsewhere (Steeples,

et al., 1987). Relative to the interpretation of distinct clusters

of epicentral locations (Plate 1), Steeples (1982) has stated (p.
73) that “the trends of microquake activity [in Kansas] define zones

in the basement, where sufficient fault-related permeability might

exist to allow the circulation of fluids from the deep crust."

structural Information

Prior to drafting Plate 4, the author prepared a revised version (not atiown} of Cole’s (1976) and Sims’ (1985) maps of the
Precambrain surface. Well control for this map consisted of about
280 oil and gas tests that penetrated the Precambrian and was taken
primarily from Cole and Watney (1985), with post-1983 data provided
by the University of Kansas, Project Upper Crust (Lanny Lathan,
written comm., May 11, 1988), and the Kansas Geological Survey (Lynn
Watney, written comm., May 13, 1988). In addition to basement
faults mapped by Cole and Sims, the locations of known or suspected
faults mapped in overlying strata (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, Map 6;
Curtis, 1960; Newell, 1987) were extended down to the Precambrain
surface following the assumption of Berendsen and Blair (1986, p. 3)
that "a fault present in a mapped unit must cut the underlying older
rocks as well." On Plate 4 these "probable faults" appear to be
concentrated along the Nemaha uplift because of the fairly high
drilling density there and very limited well control over the remainder of the area. Additionally, linear structural trends on the
revised basement map that could conceivably represent faults were
annotated on this map in much the same fashion as Berendsen and
others (1978, Fig. 3) treated Cole’s (1976) map. Features portrayed
as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4 are thus a composite of
those mapped by Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18, reproduced as
Figure 4 here) and additional basement fractures interpreted in this
study from the above-mentioned basement structure trends, and linea
ments interpreted from geophysical, remotely sensed, drainage, and

58

earthquake foci data (see Discussion section below).

Soil Gas Data

Soil gas measurements used in the present investigation (Plate
1) represent a composite of 190 soil gas hydrogen values obtained by
the U.S. Geological Survey in July, 1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986;
McCauley and Watney, 1984) and an as yet unpublished dataset of just
over 400 measurements acquired since that time by Ernest E. Angino
and coworkers as part of an ongoing study of the Kansas hydrogen
occurrence. Soil gas samples and hydrogen determinations for these
two studies were obtained by different techniques.

The procedure used by the U.S. Geological Survey has been
described in considerable detail by McCarthy and others (1986, p.
9). In general, it consisted of driving a 0.75 m (2.5 ft.) long

(0.3 in?) gas

hollow steel probe in the soil, withdrawing a 5 cm
sample with a syringe, and analyzing it immediately in a truckmounted mass spectrometer. This uncalibrated procedure produced
measurements of relative hydrogen concentration only. Values reported here as "small anomalies" and "medium anomalies" on Plate 4 from
this dataset are those considered "possible anomalies" and "anomalies" by McCauley and Watney (1984, Fig. 5B, 10) on the basis of
degree of positive deviation from their daily (downward) trends.
The very shallow nature of their sampling depth probably produced
considerable diurnal variations in hydrogen concentrations (Gole and

Butt, 1985, p. 2112; Sato, et al., 1986, p. 12,321) which they

apparently did not attempt to account for. The deeper sampling of

59

the Angino group was an attempt to overcome this problem.

The methodology of Angino and coworkers has not been previously
described and is outlined here (Ernest E. Angino, verbal comm., May
27, 1988). Trailer or truck-mounted power soil augers were used to
drill 5 cm (2 in.) diameter holes to average depths of about 3 m (10
ft.) [actual range = 2-4.5 m (6-14 ft.)] at locations on private
lands spaced about every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) [locally 0.8 km (0.5 mi.)]
along sample traverse roads (Plate 1). Holes were cased with conmercially available 5 cm (2 in.) diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipes of an appropriate length. PVC pipes had been slotted on the
lower 60 cm (2 ft.) and were fitted on the top with a septunequipted PVC end cap. Pipes were pumped to partial vacuum and left
undisturbed for a period of about 15 minutes, allowing soil gasses
to collect within the pipes. Gas samples were then withdrawn
through the septa with a 100 cm? (6.0 in.?) syringe and analyzed
immediately in portable gas chromatographs. 269 analyses were performed prior to the 1987 field year and utilized a Hewlett Packard
5890A model gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector
and a 1 meter capillary column. This technique produced only relative measurements of soil gas hydrogen concentrations (sample locations indicated as "Relative Values" on Plate 1). Gas analyses
performed since that time utilized a field-ruggedized, HNU Series
301 model portable gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity
detector and a 4 meter capillary column. Alternate analyses of 100
cm? (6.0 in.) samples of a calibrated gas standard (stated concen
trations of 1000 ppm + 1% Hy, 500 ppm +1% He) during this latter

60

cs

period allowed absolute determinations of 135 hydrogen concentrations to be made (sample locations marked “Absolute Values" on Plate
1). Sdhsequent vesenp ling of some of the older, "relative" stations
empirically demonstrated a nearly linear relationship existed between the two types of measurements.

To facilitate comparison of hydrogen anomaly magnitudes from
these two sources, highly anomalous measurements were grouped into 4
relative classes in an approach that differs slightly from that of
Cunningham and others (1987, p. 218). The population means and
standard deviations of each group ("Relative Values", and "Absolute
Values") were determined seperately (Figure 13), and all values
exceeding the mean for the data type were considered anomalous for
mapping purposes. All measurements below the mean for each data
type were considered to represent a regional "background" population
(although quite high by global standards, see for example Ware, et
al., 1984), and are portrayed on Plate 4 accordingly. Measurements
between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and those greater than 3 standard
deviations above the population mean for each respective group are
portrayed on Plate 4 as "small", "medium", and "large" anomalies
respectively. Interestingly, 32% of the values of each group exceed
the corresponding means and are thus considered anomalous. This may
be an indication that both populations represent statistically valid
samples of a single population in spite of slightly different gas

sampling procedures and analytical techniques.

RESULTS

Drainage Analysis

Analysis of drainage network maps for that portion of Kansas
lying between 38 an 40 degrees north latitude and 96 and 98 degrees
west longitude (including all of the present study area) was completed at an early stage in this investigation and resulted in the
delineation of 644 linear stream segments totaling 6023 km (3743
mi.) in length from all drainage basins exceeding 10 kin? (3.9 mi.)
in area. A more detailed discussion of the results from this analySis is available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987), but, in general,
the correlation of the single broad north-south mode in this data
with known geologic controls was found to be poor. Nonetheless, a
length-weighted azimuthal histogram ("rose diagram") has been compiled in 10 degree increments from the linear drainage segments
mapped during that investigation and is included here (Figure 14B)
for comparison with other linear feature data.

Length-weighted values, as opposed to simple orientation frequencies, were utilized in compiling the drainage rose diagram, and
all subsequent diagrams, because this approach permits direct quantitative comparisons of orientation tendencies for many data types
to be made, regardless of sample size. In addition, correlation
coefficients between linear-feature orientation frequency and cummulative length for each data type are all slightly positive (eg. for
drainage alignments, r = +0.11), indicating that those linear fea
tures possessing the more abundant orientations also tend to be

63

slightly longer. These two factors (length-weighting, and positive
length/frequency correlations) are additive and thus tend to produce
fairly "spikey" rose diagrams. Note also that the radial scales (in
percentage by length) of these diagrams vary from figure to figure
in order to portray the maximum rays of each diagram at approximately similar physical lengths, further facilitating comparison of
the different types of data. During examination of these rose
diagrams, the reader should bear in mind that a truly random distribution of linear element orientations would statistically tend to
produce a rose diagram with all 18 rays of approximately 5.6% in
length (100% / 18 rays = 5.6% / ray).
Imagery Analysis

Analysis of study area Landsat imagery produced a sompogite of
242 straight or nearly straight photolineaments totaling 2132 km
(1325 mi.) in length and 50 distinctly curved photolineaments.
Comparison of these photolineaments with the drainage network (Plate
2) shows that almost all photolineaments of both types correspond to
linear or semicircular drainage features respectively. This finding
concurs with most previous studies reported in the literature.
Given that most of these features correspond with surface drainage
elements, the locations of which are precisely defined, both the
locational accuracy and orientational precision of these features
are considered very good. Some of the strongly curved photolineaments ("curvilineaments" of some other authors) also appear to
correlate with structural domes, horsts, or grabens as mapped by

Berendsen and Blair (1986), and Cole (1976) along the Nemaha anti
65

cline, and, to a lesser degree, with circular aeromagnetic (Yarger,
et al., 1981) or gravity (Yarger, et al., 1985) anomalies. Other
than these general observations, further analysis of the possible
tectonic significance of curved photolineaments was not attempted.

Cursory examination of Plate 2 reveals that two fairly distinct
azimuthal modes are present in the straight photolineament data.
These trends have been quantified with a length-weighted rose diagram (Figure 14A) of their orientations. Because of the obvious
difficulties and dubious value in determining average azimuthal
values for the strongly curved photolineaments, these features have
been excluded from this compilation. One wide, but fairly distinct,
mode occurs at about N.10°E. A less prominant and narrower mode
occurs at about N.40°W. Note that neither of these modal orientations agrees well with any of the well-documented regional joint
trends (N.60-75°E., N.10-35°W., and N.70-83°W.) of the eastern
Kansas-Oklahoma area as discussed above.

This bimodal distribution of study area photolineaments resembles fairly closely the results of Anderson's (1981, Fig. 7b) study
of Landsat photolineaments in an adjoining area of southeastern
Nebraska, although his modes appear to be offset clockwise by about
20 and 10 degrees respectively. In addition, he interpreted (p. 19)
a broad northeastern maximum to represent a composite of two narrower modes. From extensive comparisons with many possible geologic
causes, he concluded that many of the photolineaments could mark the
surface traces of a periodically rejuvinated regional basement frac
ture system.

66

These two prominant modes at N.40°W. and N.30°E., as well as
two less frequent modal orientations of N.15°W. and N.65-70°E., were
also present in the Landsat photolineaments mapped by Dwivedi
(1983). He attributed both sets of photolineaments to a conjugate
fracture system produced by wrench faulting of the Nemaha anticline
and related structures near his study area in south-central Kansas.
Jefferis (1969, Fig. 10A) also documented a nearly identical N.40°W.
mode and a N.50°E. mode in radar photolineaments from southern Douglas County which he ascribed (p. 31) to "major faults and zones of
fracture concentrations." Callen (1983) mapped a large number of
Landsat photolineaments in the Forest City basin and concluded that
at least two individual features in Atchison, Jefferson, and Leavenworth counties, Kansas, reflected two previously unrecognized northeast and northwest-oriented basement faults. He later (1985) used
several basinwide trend surface maps of mean photolineament azimuths
to infer a distinct influence of the Missouri gravity low on the
structural development of the basin.

Orientation statistics have apparently never been compiled for
the remainder of the major photolineament studies in Kansas (Cooley,
1984, 1986; McCauley, 1988; McCauley, et al., 1978; Podwysocki,
1974), but visual examination of each these maps demonstrates that
both the northeast and northwest modes are regionally pervasive.
For example, Cooley (1984) mapped a large number of Landsat photolineaments in western Kansas, and that portion of his map which
overlaps the southwestern corner of the study area is presented here

(Figure 15). Note that, although photolineaments with virtually

every orientation are present, north-northeast and northwest-oriented features are much more abundant and tend to be considerably
longer than the others. Although it is fairly obvious that not
every single one of the photolineaments he mapped corresponds to an
actual geologic or structural feature, it is apparent that a nonrandom componant is certainly present and it does at least seem likely

that it could reflect such a genetic origin.

Gravity and Magnetic Features

Upon initial examination of Plate 3 it is readily apparent that
two prominant orientations also exist for both types of linear
geophysical elements mapped. Compilations of the 71 gravity lineaments totaling 1687 km (1048 mi.) in length , and 94 magnetic lineaments 2560 km (1591 mi.) in cumulative length (Figure 16) appearing
on this map serve to clarify these two prominant modes. These modes
are nearly identical in both orientation and magnitude on both rose
diagrams, and correlate well with the modes determined by Lam (1987)
for gravity and Yarger (1983) for aeromagnetic lineaments in eastern
Kansas (Figure 12). They are also remarkably similar to the modes
determined for photolineaments above. Given the reasonable spatial
resolution of the original aeromagnetic data (see Methodology section), the locational and orientational precisions of the magnetic
features are considered fairly good, although not as good as photolineament data. However, the wide spacing of gravity stations over
most of the study area (see Methodology section) probably degraded

gravity feature locational and, to a lesser extent, orientational

69

od

accuracies considerably.

With closer examination of Plates 2 and 3, it becomes apparent
that the patterns of linear features in the northwestern half of
each map differ somewhat from those present in the southeastern
halves. A more-or-less distinct discontinuity between these patterns appears to correspond with the location of the eastern flank
of the Abilene anticline. Additional rose diagrams have thus been
compiled for Landsat (Figure 17), gravity (Figure 18), and magnetic
(Figure 19) features with respect to whether they have been mapped
northwest of, or southeast of, the Abilene anticline. Although both
of the prominant modes mentioned above are still apparent in both
gravity and magnetic trends, their relative importance is reversed
across the Abilene structure. Northwest-oriented geophysical features predominate in the eastern portion of the maps, whereas northnortheast trending features are considerably more abundant to the
west. This is also true for Landsat photolineaments, but the northnortheast mode has shifted to nearly due north for photolineaments
in the western half of Plate 2. The possible significance of this

shift is not understood.

Basement Structure

The 49 linear features, totaling 1505 km (935 mi.) in length,
mapped on the revised contour map of basement configuration (see
Methodology section) are shown on Plate 3 and their orientations are
compiled on Figure 20A. Again note a prominant mode centered on

N.30-40°E. and a very small secondary mode at about N.50°W.

71

DISCUSSION

Structural Interpretations

In general, with the possible exception of drainage trends,
each of the foregoing compilations of data appears distinctly bimodal, with prominant modes at about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This
close correlation of orientation statistics for linear features
extracted from such widely differing basic data sources [ie. certain
river and stream orientations (linear drainage segments) and areal
spectral reflectance characteristics (Landsat photolineaments),
areal variations in rock magnetic properties (magnetic lineaments)
and rock density (gravity lineaments), and basement surface configuration (linear structural trends)] implies a similar genetic cause.
Comparison of these features with the locations (Plate 4) and orientations (Figure 20B) of the 73 probable study area faults as
previously mapped using subsurface data by Berendsen and Blair
(1986) and Newell (1987) indicates a close correlation exists here
also, again implying a causal relationship. Many of the gravity and
magnetic linear features mapped elsewhere in Kansas are thought to
correspond in both orientation and location with basement discontinuities controlled by faults and anticlines (see Introduction and
Methodology sections above). Therefore, I suggest that the two
prominant modes for linear features in the structural, geophysical,
and remotely sensed data sets of the study area also reflect a
bimodal basement fracture and fault system. Thus, all features por
trayed as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4, with the excep
76

tion those modified after Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18,
presented here as Figure 4 in Introduction section), have been
inferred on the basis of linear features on recorded on Plates 2 and
3. In general, the locations of most of these "possible faults or
fractures" were interpreted from any combination of spatially coincident gravity lineaments, aeromagnetic lineaments, structural lineaments, linear drainage segments, or Landsat photolineaments. Some
were inferred on the basis of aeromagnetic lineaments alone, particularly those oriented either NW or NNE, and a few represent linear
features that correlated well with the extensions of previously
mapped subsurface faults. A discussion of each feature and contributing data sources would be too lengthy to include here, so the
reader is urged to consult the source maps (Plates 2, and 3) for the
following discussion and during evaluation of the interpretative map
(Plate 4).

Many, perhaps most, of the northwest-oriented fractures in the
eastern portion of Plate 4 are probably genetically related to a set
of similarly oriented basement fault zones previously infered to
exist in the granitic basement over much of eastern Kansas and
western Missouri (Berendsen and Blair, 1984; Berendsen, et al.,
1978; Kisvarsanyi, 1974; McCracken, 1971). One of these, the
Bolivar-Mansfield fault zone (Plate 4), appears to intersect the
Nemaha anticline in a structurally complex portion near southeast
Riley County and continues westward through the Abilene anticline
very close to several of the Riley County kimberlites (Berendsen, et

al., 1988, p. 16). These northwest-oriented fractures parallel the

77

~

bounding faults of the Missouri gravity low and it seems possible
that this fault set could represent a Phanerozoic structural event
imposed. on the basement rocks of the region, or could have
originated from tensional fracturing of the upper crust during the
middle? Proterozoic (>1,350 to 1,485 Ma) tectonic event thought to
be responsible for producing the Missouri gravity low. It also
seems possible that the locations and orientations of these faults,
as well as the overall trend of the Missouri gravity low, may
reflect regionally pervasive set of even older crustal weaknesses.
These weaknesses could also have resulted from the roughly dated
(1,800 to 1,400 Ma ?) middle Proterozoic shearing episode discussed
above (see Introduction section), or could conceivably have been
incurred even earlier during early Proterozoic accretion of the
Central Plains province itself (Bickford, et al., 1986, p. 494).
Yarger (1983, p. 27) has stated that most of the northwest-oriented
aeromagnetic features of eastern are interupted at the rift by the
north-northeast features which characterize this zone, implying that
"the northwest grain is older than the rift." Alternatively, the
mechanism which produced the northwest set could postdate formation
of the rift and have simply failed to produce many of these features
within the preexisting rift zone.

Likewise, many of the inferred north-northeast oriented
fractures, so pervasive along the Nemaha anticline and west of the
Abilene anticline, probably correspond with basement fault zones
trending parallel to the Midcontinent rift system axial zone and may

have resulted from tensional stresses associated with middle Proter
78

ozoic (about 1,100 to 950 Ma) formation of this rift, although they
too may reflect earlier crustal anisotropy.

The. north-northeast-oriented fractures show an apparent tendency (Plate 4) to be expressed as zones of fairly closely spaced
fractures (notably the Nemaha and Abilene anticlines, Washington
structure, and possibly the Belleville fault) seperated by wide
areas of relatively unfractured basement. Of these four zones, two
(Nemaha and Belleville) are spatially coincident with abundant historic seismic activity (Plate 1). The former is expressed by over
1,000 m (3,000 ft.) of vertical Phanerozoic fault displacement and
the latter corresponds with the traditionally mapped western limit
of the Rice Formation (Bickford, et al., 1979). The other two
features (Abilene and Washington) have been interpreted as _ the
eastern and western boundaries of rift-related mafic basement rocks
respectively (eg. see Bickford, et al., 1979), and correspond with

both the steepest gradients on the central gravity high of Bouguer

t al., 1985) and distinct discontinuities

gravity maps (eg. Yarger,
on aeromagnetic images of the study area (eg. Yarger, et al., 1981).
In addition, the Abilene anticline was observed (see Results section) to mark the boundary between two distinct areas of linearfeature characteristics, but shows only about 100 m (300 ft.) of
Phanerozoic vertical displacement.

I believe these latter two features (Abilene and Washington)
reflect deep crustal zones that acted as fundamental controls on the

location and structure of the rift zone during extension, including

magma intrusion and extrusion, but are no longer very active tecton
79
ically (as shown structurally and seismically), perhaps because of
"healing" by the extensive rift-related magmatism. The proximity of
the Riley County (Cretaceous age) kimberlites to the Abilene anticline could reflect this deep crustal fracturing. The other two
features (Nemaha and Belleville) could have acted as important
controls on rift-basin and post-rift basement geometry, affecting
the locations of the "east Rice basin" and "west Rice basin", but
were sufficiently distal from active rift magmatism that they have
remained zones of deep crustal weakness through the present.

Taken together these two infered fault sets comprise a well
defined "gridded fault pattern" similar to that proposed for the
northern portion of the Midcontinent rift in Michigan, Minnesota,
and Wisconsin (McSwiggen, et al., 1987; Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985)
and typical of continental rifts in general (Ramberg and Smithson,
1975). This bimodal fracture system could segment the upper crust
of northern Kansas into large orthogonal blocks, as has been suggested for elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Zabawa, 1978). It is
probable, given the relatively thin cover of Phanerozoic sediments
relative to the thick Precambrian crust, that such a pervasive
system of deep fractures (particularly the unhealed rift marginal
sets) could have been periodically reactivated by external tectonic
stresses through time (Ford, 1983). Theoretically at least, the
orientation of any individual fracture plane relative to these
stresses would determine the style of deformation (normal, reverse,
strike-slip, or a combination thereof) associated with any rejuvina
tion event (Peterson, 1985a, 1985b). The complex fault geometries

80

and horst/graben structures presently associated with some of these
fault zones (eg. Humboldt fault zone) may represent near-surface
fault splays resulting from several episodes of convergent wrench
movement along the deeply seated (possibly listric) rift-marginal
master faults (see Wilcox, et al ., 1973, Fig. 15; Zabawa, 1978,
Fig. 27). Episodic reactivation of such zones could also have
produced differential uplift or downdropping of larger crustal
blocks, causing local paleobathymetric and paleotopographic relief
(Gustavson, 1983). Such irregularities might have resulted in important lithologic and structural trends in the overlying Phanerozoic sedimentary package, particularly in water-depth sensitive
near-shore settings (see Introduction section). With adequate constraints on paleostress fields and fracture orientations it might be
possible to predict deformational styles and related lithostratigraphic influences (including petroleum trapping potential) in the
Phanerozoic rocks of the poorly explored, deeper portions of the
Salina basin (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4; Newell, et al., 1988b).
Conversely, in areas of sufficient control, such as along certain
portions of the Nemaha structure, consideration of fault plane
geometries and associated lithotectonic expressions of deformational
styles could perhaps serve to confirm or refute reconstructions of
regional paleostress fields.

The spatial proximity of modern seismicity (Plate 1) to many of
these supposed faults (Humboldt fault zone, Belleville fault, and,
of particular note, the Poersch fault) strongly suggests that move
ment continues along at least some of them at present. Such activi
81

ty could be responsible for propagating these fracture zones upward
to the present land surface, perhaps in the form of zones of more
intense jointing or more rarely as actual faults with stratigraphic
offsets, where they are now expressed as modern drainage alignments
and photolineaments. The overall lack of resistant beds in the
Wellington Formation and the resultant paucity of outcrops over much
of the central portion of the study area (where the largest hydrogen
anomalies occur) precluded evaluation of this hypothesis in the
field using a suitable approach for detecting such zones (for example see Wheeler and Dixon, 1980).

If such intensely jointed zones do exist, however, they could
theoretically provide enhanced permeability pathways for vertically
moving free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. It is also likely
that their ages and tectonic history could have produced different
internal geometries, thereby affecting relative permeabilities
(Schrauf and Evans, 1984). Furthermore, their three dimensional
orientations relative to the modern horizontal stress field should
profoundly influence their fluid conductivity characteristics (Merin
and Moore, 1986). Internal geometry factors (age, genetic origin,
etc.) being equal, those fracture zones oriented subparallel with
the modern principal horizontal stress (ie. approximately eastnortheast) would be expected to be the most "open" to vertically

migrating fluids.

Visual inspection of the locations of linear features (Plates 2

82
~
and 3), infered fractures (Plate 4), and anomolous soil gas samples
(Plate 4) reveals that many of the "medium," "large," and "very
large" hydrogen anomalies occur on, very near, or along the extensions of linear features and suspected fractures. Of particular
note are several anomalies located along the two infered faults
bounding the northern extension of the Lindsborg anticline, numerous
anomalies along the Chapman Creek fracture, and several anomalies
(including the largest “relative" sample of all) located near the
Poersch fault mentioned above. Additional examples could be cited.
Some "small" anomalies also appear to be spatially correlated with
such features. Given the large sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0 mi.),
these findings are somewhat surprising, and suggest a slightly positive correlation may exist between anomaly magnitudes and their
relative proximities to linear features in spite of the coarse sample spacing. However, note that a large number of nonanomalous
values also occur close to linear features. This relationship has
been noted in other studies. Richers and others (1986, Fig. 13)
provided a hypothetical fracture model that can account for these
observations (Figure 21 here). Additional soil-gas sampling at
close intervals (50 to 200 ft.) across one or more of the above
mentioned specific features might serve as a test of the model in
Kansas. Sampling across the trace of a surface fault documented in
Ottawa County (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962) that parallels the inferred
northwest-oriented fracture set, and might help establish the relative importance of actual fault zones as hydrogen conduits (Ware, et

al., 1984) for the Kansas occurrence. Smoothed regional trends of

likely to reflect the gross geometry of deep source areas or zones,
than localized near-surface transportation routes.

I believe that the apparent correlation between fracture locations and hydrogen soil-gas anomaly magnitudes, however slight, does
reflect vertical movement of the gas through basement fault and
fracture zones into corresponding (implied, but as yet undocumented)
near-surface fracture zones. Probably the most accurate, and perhaps only, way to verify the existance and nature of these infered
fracture zones, to quantify their various permeability factors, and
determine their relative importance as hydrogen conduits would be to
actually penetrate several of these zones with appropriately located
boreholes utilizing deviated drilling techniques (Figure 22), and
perform relevant core analyses and drillstem tests. Among the particular features to be recomended for such testing at this point are
the inferred Chapman Creek fracture zone, faults flanking the Lindsborg anticline (eg. Salina fault), the Poersch fault, and any other
pronounced anomaly/linear feature combinations detected by additional soil-gas sampling. Assuming such zones were penetrated and
showed evidence of substantially enhanced hydrogen movement, determination of the presence or absence of a reasonably hydrogen-impermeable sealing horizon (salt?, bentonitic shale?) could affect the
potential exploitability of the occurrence. And finally, if the
viability of a hydrogen resource could be demonstrated, additional
reconnaissance-level soil-gas sampling and down-hole testing along

much of the Midcontinent rift system might be warranted.

CONCLUSIONS

Fracture Pattern

The Precambrian basement rocks of the study area are typified
by a bimodally distributed fracture pattern with modal orientations
close to N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This bimodal fracture pattern is
expressed as linear trends in gravity and aeromagnetic data, earthquake foci locations, structural surfaces, kimberlite axes, and as
stratigraphic offsets in seismic data. Surficial indications of it,
such as drainage alignments and spatial variations in spectral
response as detected by Landsat (ie. photolineaments), may reflect
zones of increased near-surface joint intensity over deeper fault
zones.

The northwest-oriented fracture set is apparently the older set
and may date from tensional forces associated with middle(?) Proterozoic formation of the Missouri gravity low or perhaps earlier
accretion of the Central Plains orogen. The north-northeast fracture set probably resulted from axial-parallel normal faulting in
response to tensional stresses during Keewenawan age rifting of the
Midcontinent rift system, but it is also possible that both the
gross rift trend and subsidiary fault locations may also have been
largely controlled by older crustal weaknesses.

This bimodal fracture pattern has been periodically reactivated
differentially throughout Phanerozoic time in response to changes in
crustal stress regimes, due primarily to plate tectonic interactions

at the North American continental margins. This periodic reactiva
86

~

tion is expressed as progressive-displacement-through-time (growth)
faults, fault-proximal Paleozoic lithology and thickness changes,
localized Cretaceous intrusive activity, and modern seismicity. The
styles of movement along particular fractures have changed variously
with geologic time and this is probably a function of fracture plane
orientation and principal stress direction. Nearby tectonic events
(eg. Ouchita orogeny, Laramide orogeny) have produced major local
effects and well-constrained paleostress directions for these events
may permit predictive modeling of resultant deformation styles on
the basis of fracture orientations in areas of poor subsurface control (Salina basin for example). Parallel sets of through-going
fractures (Belleville and Nemaha fault zones) could also have acted
as conjugate shear couples, resulting in local reorientation of the
principal horizontal stress, complicating this interpretation procedure considerably. The origin and tectonic history of a given fracture has probably influenced its internal geometry and intrinsic
permeability characteristics. The modern principal horizontal
stress in the Midcontinent is oriented approximately east-northeastwest-southwest. Fracture-geometry considerations aside, knowledge
of subsurface stress orientations might permit predictions of the
relative "openness" (net permeability) of individual fractures or

fracture sets, such as might affect intrafracture fluid movement.

Soil Gas Relations

Hydrogen detected in soil gases undoubtly originates below the

Phanerozoic-Precambrian interface, perhaps from the active serpenti
87

nization of rift-related mafic rocks, perhaps from deep circulation
and mixing of different formation waters, perhaps from deep-crustal
or mantle outgassing. It almost certainly moves vertically primarily through fractures, either dissolved in formation fluids or as
free gas. The present soil-gas sample density is probably insufficient to delineate, with any degree of certainty, the individual
near-surface fracture zones acting as these possible conduits.
Evaluation of the viability of potential future exploitation of
the hydrogen probably hinges on very accurate delineation of the
major fracture zones through which hydrogen could be moving (not
possible in this study due to inadequate data source resolutions),
the presence of suitable sealing horizons (salt?, bentonitic
shales?), and the use of appropriate well drilling and completion

practices.

Future Research

Suggestions for further research related to the fracture pattern of north-central Kansas, the Midcontinent rift system, and the
Kansas hydrogen occurrences include:

1) Digital processing and reinterpretation of the higher resolution (1 mile by 1 mile nominal station spacing) gravity data
presently being acquired over the study area by the Kansas Geological Survey.

2) Acquisition, enhancement, and interpretation of high resolution, low altitude aeromagnetic data.

3) Installation of additional seismic stations to improve loca
88

tional accuracy and provide a lower event-magnitude detection limit.

4) Acquisition of short, high resolution seismic lines across
the Abilene anticline, Washington structure, or Belleville fault to
determine if Phanerozoic deformation is fault-controlled and the
importance of these structural zones at sub-Phanerozoic levels.

5) Acquisition of closely spaced (50 to 200 feet) soil-gas
hydrogen determinations across those linear features spatially correlated with substantial hydrogen anomalies in the present data set
(eg. Chapman Creek) or known surface faults (eg. Ottawa County) to
test for the presence of inar-sutface enhanced gas-flux effects.

6) Evaluation the possible influence of geomorphic and soil
factors (texture, clay mineralogy, moisture content, etc.) on hydrogen anomaly magnitudes.

7) Determination of hydrogen gas contents of any presently
cased petroleum wells and selected ground water wells in the Clay
County, northern Dickinson County, eastern Ottawa County, and northern Saline County area.

8) Rig-side determination of hydrogen content of gases exsolved
from drilling muds during the drilling of all future petroleum tests
in the vicinity of the Midcontinent rift, both in Kansas and elsewhere along its extent.

9) Targetting of a specific fracture zone for testing, use of
directional drilling to increase probability of fracture intersection, and appropriate core analysis and drill-stem testing.

10) Extension of reconnaissance-level sampling to the north and

west to further define the areal extent of the gas occurrences.

ABSTRACT

Lineament analysis of digitally filtered gravity and aeromagnetic data for that portion of north-central Kansas bounded by
38.5°N. and 40.0°N. latitude and 96.0°W. and 98.0°W. longitude
suggests the basement is characterized by a bimodal set of linear
compositional discontinuities. These discontinuities are interpreted to reflect an intrabasement fracture pattern with modal
orientations of about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. These prefered
orientations are also expressed as linear elements in a revised
contour map of the Precambrian surface configuration, indicating
Phanerozoic movement has taken place along many of them. The northwest-oriented fracture set parallels regional basement fault zones
associated with the Middle Proterozoic(?) Missouri gravity low and
may have resulted from the tensional(?) stresses responsible for
formation of that feature. The north-northeast-oriented set parallels the central axis of the Midcontinent rift system and probably
reflects extensive tensional faulting inferred to have accompanied
the Middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) rifting. Alternatively, both
sets could reflect even older upper-crustal anisotropy. Clustering
of historic earthquake and recent microquake epicenters around
several of these fracture zones demonstrates that some are still
active. Such recurrent seismicity, perhaps in combination with
differential isostatic rebound since Pleistocene glaciation, could
provide a mechanism for upward propagation of these zones.

Although surface faults are virtually unknown from the study

area, correlation between the locations and modal orientations of

the inferred basement fractures and both Landsat photolineaments,
and linear drainage segments, is good to fair. This may imply that
many of these fractures are expressed at the present land surface as
zones of preferential weathering, perhaps in the form of linear
zones of increased joint density.

Comparison between the magnitudes of nearly 600 hydrogen soil
gas measurements and their relative proximity to these suspected
fractures indicates that at least some of these zones may extend to
the present land surface and act as preferential conduits for vertical migration of free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. However,
it is concluded that the present soil-gas sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0
mi.) is too coarse to accurately define the exact surface traces of
these fractures. The viability of future exploitation of the hydrogen is still unknown, but will probably depend on more precise
definition of these zones, the presence of a suitable trapping
mechanism, and drilling and completion practices appropriate for the

occurrence.

INTRODUCTION

Background Information

In 1982, unusually high concentrations of free hydrogen (30 to
40 mole %) and nitrogen (60 to 70 mole %) were detected in casinghead gases of the CFA Oil Co. #1 Scott well in northwest Morris

County, Kansas (Goebel, et al., 1983a; 1983b) and the CFA Oil Co. #1

Heins well (Plate 1) in southern Geary County, Kansas (Goebel, et
al., 1984). Hydrogen was subsequently detected during actual
drilling of several other nearby wells (Goebel, et al., 1985) and
numerous hydrogen anomalies were indicated along two soil-gas sample
traverses (Plate 1) run by the Kansas and U.S. Geological Surveys in
1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986; McCauley and Watney, 1984). Although
the origin of the nitrogen has remained somewhat of an enigma, a
search of the relevant literature revealed a minimum of eight possible mechanisms for generating such anomalously high concentrations

of hydrogen in the subsurface (Angino, et al., 1984). The absence

of appreciable CH, or CO, with the gases is indicative of an abiogenic source for the hydrogen. Isotopic ratios and thermodynamic
calculations yield possible equilibration temperatures around 10
degrees C or lower (somewhat below ambient temperature), implying a
deuturium-depleted gas source. The currently most plausible origins
for the Kansas occurrences include ground-water mixing, mantle outgassing, and the the hydration of FeO-rich minerals (for example
olivine) during serpentinization/deserpentinization of mafic or

ultramafic rocks (Coveny, et al., 1987). Of these theories, the

latter may be favored by the position of the occurrence above the
southern end of the Keweenawan-age Midcontinent rift system (central
North American rift system), known to contain partially serpenti
nized mafic rocks (Berendsen,

t al., 1988), and close proximity to
several known kimberlite plugs (Mansker, et al., 1987). Analyses of
gases exsolved from drilling muds during drilling of the CFA Oil #1
Simpson well (Coveney, et al., 1987, fig. 3), CFA Oil #1 Amthauer
well (Plate 1), and wireline well logs of other nearby wells
(Goebel, 1985) have established a stratigraphic range for the hydrogen extending from soil level to the top of the Precambrian basement, further suggesting an intrabasement source.

Although the maximum areal extent of the occurrence is still
rather poorly defined, soil-gas sampling along extensive traverses
(Plate 1) indicates areas in at least 10 Kansas counties are
involved. The highest levels of hydrogen detected along initial
soil-gas traverses were from near the centers of “unusually
straight" stream valleys and an area of Pleistocene(?) age sand
dunes northwest of Abilene (Angino, 1985). Although Phanerozoic
strata in the area of the gas occurrences are essentially flat
lying, the locations and orientations of many streams and rivers in
eastern Kansas are thought to have been influenced by regional joint
trends (Baehr, 1954; McCauley, et al., 1975), near-surface faults
(DuBois, 1978), and reactivated basement fracture zones (Kirk, 1968:
Berendsen, et al., 1978). This suggests that both the near-surface

concentrations and subsurface movements of the hydrogen may be

strongly fracture controlled. If this is true, then knowledge of

ne Ne A A NR OT

the fracture patterns may provide a fundamental key to understanding
the origin, possible trapping, and potential development of this
resource. Although down-hole gas pressures have so far been quite

low (slightly above 1 atm., Coveney, et al., 1987, p. 42), it is

conceivable that such widespread occurrences of anomalous soil-gas
hydrogen could represent the surface expression of a very significant (if economically extractable) future source of energy and raw
materials. Indeed, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986, p. 120) have

predicted that "in the future the extraction and refining of gases

containing hydrogen will become a separate branch of industry."

Study Objectives

In an attempt to clarify further any relationship between
subsurface fractures and hydrogen gas distribution, an integrated
analysis of geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and remotely sensed
data was undertaken for a large area of north-central Kansas. The
primary objectives of this study as originally stated were: 1) to
determine the fracture pattern of the study area with an emphasis on
remote techniques, 2) to relate fracture types and trends to possible tectonic origin(s) and modern crustal stress regime, 3) to
compare hydrogen soil-gas anomalies with fracture locations, and 4)

to develop a working model for subsurface movement of the hydrogen.

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA

Location and Surficial Geology

The study area comprises that portion of north-central Kansas
lying between 96 and 98 degrees west longitude and 38.5 and 40
degrees north latitude, corresponding to the entire Manhattan and
northern one half of the Hutchinson 1:250,000-scale series U.S.
Geological Survey topographic quadrangle sheets. It covers
approximately 28,500 km” (11,000 mi.) of surface area and includes
all or portions of 25 Kansas counties (Figure 1).

Strata cropping out in the study area range from Late Pennsylvanian through Recent in age (Kansas Geological Survey, 1964).
Late Paleozoic and Cretaceous rocks include a sequence of
interlayered marine carbonates and fine terrigenous clastics. The
Middle Permian age Wellington Formation crops out in the central
portion of the study area. It includes a thick salt sequence, the
Hutchinson Salt Member, in much of the Kansas subsurface (Watney and
Paul, 1980), but this salt has been removed from all except the
southwesternmost part of the study area by surface erosion and
subsurface solution (Plate 1). Deposits of Cenozoic age are of
generally minor importance except for thick alluvial fills in larger
stream valleys and a mantle of Pleistocene glaciofluvial sediments
northeast of the Kansan age glacial terminus (Plate 1). Locally in
northern Dickinson and portions of surrounding counties, sandy areas
and small sand dunes of Quaternary age occur on the uplands (Dunlap,

1977; Jantz and Saffry, 1980; Sloanaker, 1950).

Basement Lithologies and Proterozoic Tectonics

The lithologic and structural characteristics of Precambrian
rocks in north-central Kansas are known only from widely scattered
drill hole samples and regional correlations. Holes penetrating
basement rocks within the study area number only about 280, but most
of these occur in a few areas of higher drilling density (Plate 4)
and very few were drilled more than a few meters (10’s of feet) into
Precambrian rocks (Bickford, et al., 1979, 1981; Denison, et al.,
1984). Among the notable exceptions to this general depth rule are
the Hodgen Oil #1 and #1-4 Finn wells in Marshall County, and the
Texaco USA #1-31 Poersch well in Washington County (Plate 1). The
Finn wells both penetrated over 450 m. (1500 ft.) of Precambrian
rocks, and Poersch well is reported to have penetrated approximately
2600 m. (8,450 ft.) of Precambrian gabbros, basalts, and arkosic
clastics (Berendsen et al., 1988). An extensive discussion of the
units encountered in the Poersch well and their possible interpretation is available from Berendsen and others (1988). Unfortunately,
no additional data are currently available for the Finn wells.

The study area lies within the Central Plains tectonic province
(Figure 2), an early Proterozoic accretionary terrane consisting
predominantly of mesozonal granitoid rocks and gneissic metamorphic
rocks of primarily amphibolite grade facies (Bickford, et al., 1986;
Sims and Peterman, 1986). Because rocks of this province are exposed at the surface only in southeastern Wyoming, it has been defined

primarily on the basis of gross geophysical expression, and the

analysis of limited cuttings and core samples available from drill

holes. Most of these samples possess cataclastic textures, suggesting they underwent a period of extensive shearing and deformation
after emplacement. Those samples that have been radiometrically
dated yield early Proterozoic ages ranging from 1,800 to 1,600
million years ago (Ma). Locally within the province a set of anorogenic plutons dated between 1,480 and 1,450 Ma occurs. They yield
nondeformed samples, and thus roughly bracket the timing of the
shearing episode (Denison, et al., 1984, p. (C7). A northwestsoutheast-oriented tectonic grain (Figure 3) that may also reflect
this deformation has been inferred for the terrane in eastern Kansas

and western Missouri (Bickford, et al., 1986; Sims and Peterman,

1986) largely on the basis of geophysical and structural trends.
Farther east in central Missouri, a northwest-southeast-trending
gravity low (the Missouri gravity low) and corresponding set of
structural features (Missouri tectonic zone) has been mapped within
the province that has been variously interpreted as a rifted arm of

a possible "rrr-type" type triple junction (Guinness, et al., 1982;

Kisvarsanyi, 1984), major transcurrent fault (Arvidson, t al

1982), or collisional suture (Bowring, et al., 1988) that apparently
predated a middle Proterozoic (1,485 to 1,350 Ma) epizonal graniterhyolite terrane underlying much of southern Missouri, southern
Kansas, and Oklahoma. Detailed analysis of regional aeromagnetic
data in south-central Kansas by Gay (1986, 1988) suggests that an
more complex history of Proterozoic tectonism than previously

supposed may be recorded in the basement there.

gravity maps (eg. Hildenbrand, et al., 1982) and magnetic maps (eg.
Zietz, 1982) is the Midcontinent geophysical anomaly (MGA). The MGA
corresponds to the middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) age "central
North America rift system" (CNARS) of Ocola and Meyer (1973), also
known as the "Midcontinent rift system". The CNARS extends from
Lake Superior southwest to at least the southern boarder of Kansas
(Figure 2) and may continue into Oklahoma (Yarger, 1983). Basalts
cropping out in the Lake Superior region and sampled in boreholes
into the CNARS farther south yield middle Proterozoic radiometric
ages ranging from 1,250 to 950 Ma (Berendsen, et al., 1988).

The CNARS has generally been interpreted as an "aborted rift,"
but debate continues about the precise plate-tectonic event that
produced this apparent failure (Gordon and Hempton, 1983). The
CNARS cuts obliquely across the previously established Archean and
Proterozoic accretionary margins (Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985) and
this may have been a factor in its "failure." Several apparent
offsets occur along the trend of the CNARS and these have generally
been interpreted as transform faults (Carlson and Treves, 1988;
Chase and Gilmer, 1973), but Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 373)
suggested "the rift system was deflected along preexisting structures" at these locations. This latter interpretation agrees with
Ramberg and Smithson’s (1975) conclusion that rift-related faulting
generally follows preexisting fractures locally and the major trends
of rift zones reflect deep-seated crustal inhomogeneities. One such
offset occurs just north of the study area in southeastern Nebraska

and may correspond with the northwest extension of the older(?)

10
Missouri gravity low mentioned above (Arvidson, et al., 1982).
The study area lies astride the northern Kansas portion of the
CNARS (Figure 2). Early interpretations of the CNARS structure in

Kansas (Coons, 1966; Coons, et al., 1967; Scott, 1969) proposed a

central basalt-cored horst block and two flanking clastic basins.
Deep seismic reflection profiling over the CNARS in 1981 by the
Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) program in
northeastern Kansas (Plate 1) has confirmed its rift nature (Brown,
et al., 1983; Gries, 1984; Serpa, et al., 1984), but according to
their interpretation, the CNARS is now thought to consist of an
asymmetric fault-bounded basin roughly 80 km (50 mi.) wide and upto
8 km (5 mi.) deep. The basin is apparently segmented into several
sub-basins by major east-dipping normal faults and these are now
known to be filled with an interlayered sequence of coeval basalt
(900 to 1100 Ma) and arkosic clastics deposited during the time of
rifting (Berendsen, et al., 1988; Dickas and Mundrey, 1988). This
sequence of clastics, loosely termed the Rice Formation by Scott
(1966), had received considerable attention recently as a possible
commercial hydrocarbon source (Dickas, 1984; Fritz, 1985; Gustavson,
1983; Herman, et al., 1985; Lee and Kerr, 1983, 1984; McCaslin,
1984; Newell, et al., 1988a, p. 3), although initial testing has

been disappointing (Berendsen, et al., 1988). The presence of a

large mafic intrusive body at mid-crustal levels underlying the
central portion of the rift basin is indicated by gravity modelling

(Somanas, 1984) and a low velocity body in the upper mantle is

suggested by teleseismic residuals data (Hahn, 1980; Miller, 1983).

11

een et aren en a rn hE

Near the Lake Superior area, the rift zone is characterized by
two prominent sets of faults: a set of high-angle flanking faults
striking parallel to the trend of the rift, and a second set of
shorter but more numerous transverse faults striking generally
perpendicular to the trend of the rift and cutting the older set
(see Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985, Fig. 4, p. 370). Although they
were probably originally high-angle normal faults generated during
Keweenawan time by the tensional forces responsible for the rifting
event, some of the flanking faults now possess considerable reverse
stratigraphic throw and must therefore represent subsequent compression of the rift zone. For example, there is an indication on deep
seismic reflection data in southwestern Iowa that substantial Precambrian reverse throw may be present along certain rift-related
faults there (Herman, et al., 1985, p. 25). Reprocessing and interpretation of the Kansas COCORP data has also suggested possible

thrust displacements (Berendsen, et

1., 1988, p. 12) along features

previously supposed to be listric normal faults (Serpa, et al.,

1984). Few of the transverse faults in the outcrop area show this
reverse sense of movement. Because similar sets of "gridded" (axisperpendicular and axis-parallel) faults characterize many rifts
worldwide (Ramberg and Smithson, 1975), it seems reasonable to
assume such a set also typifies the CNARS in the subsurface to the
south and west of the Lake Superior area. In fact, Berendsen and
others (1988, Fig. 18) portray such a gridded fault pattern for a

portion of the CNARS in northernmost Kansas, which includes roughly

the northeastern third of the study area (Figure 4).

Contrary to the statement by Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 376)
that the CNARS shows little evidence of post-Keweenawan reactivation,
the Midcontinent rift in Kansas appears to correspond to an area of
periodic epierogenic deformation and Paleozoic faulting, relatively
abundant modern seismicity and active basement faults, and numerous
kimberlite intrusives (see below). These features, in addition to a
Cambrian age (545 Ma) carbonatite intrusion just north of the study

t al., 1975a, 1975b; Carlson, 1988)

area in Nebraska (Brookins,
attest to the deeply fractured and periodically reactivated nature
of the Midcontinent crust along the CNARS (Nishimori and Powell,

1980, p. 30-39; Sykes, 1978).

Phanerozoic History

In comparison with the Proterozoic, the Phanerozoic depositional history and structure of the study area is relatively well
known. Lower and middle Paleozoic strata preserved in the subsurface of the study area consist predominantly of marine carbonates
and siliciclastics deposited near the margin of the relatively
stable North Kansas basin (Figure 5). During this time period,
plate tectonic interactions at the continental margins produced
generally minor, epeirogenic deformation over portions of the CNARS
in Kansas (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4) and other basementinvolved structures throughout much of the Midcontinent. At least
three such orogenic episodes are recorded in the form of regional

unconformities and thickness trends within the lower and middle

Paleozoic strata of the study area (Willoughby and Berendsen, 1978a,

1978b), and locally as anomalous lithologies (Berendsen and Doveton,
1988). Detailed discussions of the gross regional Paleozoic stratigraphic and structural relations preserved in the study area are
available elsewhere (Lee, 1943, 1956).

Near the close of Mississippian time the collision of the
southern margin of the present North American plate with the South
African plate produced north-northwest-directed principal horizontal
stress, culminating in the Early Pennsylvanian Ouchita orogeny.
Compressive stress was propagated cratonward from the Ouachita orogenic front of northern Arkansas and southern Oklahoma and produced
major uplift along the Humboldt fault zone, Abilene anticline, and
similar structures throughout much of the Midcontinent (Carlson,
1988; Howe, 1988). This Late Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and (7)
Early Permian tectonic episode resulted in the formation of the
Nemaha anticline which subdivided the former North Kansas Basin into
the present day Salina and Forest City basins (Figure 6). This
uplift may have been a result of convergent left-lateral strike-slip
(wrench) faulting along preexisting northeast-trending basement
faults (Blair and Berendsen, 1985, 1988; Davis, 1984; Fenster and
Trapp, 1982; Heyl, 1977; Phipps, 1983). Detailed subsurface studies
indicate the Nemaha anticline/Humboldt fault zone consists of a
complex series of scissor faults, sigmoid anticlines, horst and
graben features, pull-apart basins (Berendsen and Blair, 1986a;
Eccles, 1981; Newell, 1987; Steeples, 1982), en-echelon fault zones
(Fath, 1920, 1921; Foley, 1926), reverse-slip faults (Smith and

Anders, 1951; Steeples and Yarger, 1983), and anastomosing fault

zones (Burchett and Arrigo, 1978), all of which are features
consistent with wrench fault deformation (eg. Harding, 1973; Maxwell
and Wise, 1958; Moody, 1973; Moody and Hill, 1956, 1964; Prucha,

1964; Sylvester, 1982; Wilcox, et al., 1973). Thus, the Humboldt

fault zone within the study area almost certainly represents a riftmarginal fault complex of the CNARS in Kansas that was reactivated
periodically throughout the Paleozoic (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, p.

4; Serpa, et al., 1984; Somanas, 1984; Yarger, 1983, p. 29).

Minor continued uplift along the Nemaha structural trend, and
to a lesser extent the associated Abilene anticline (Figure 7),
through Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian times produced significant bathymetric irregularities which had a pronounced local control
on marginal marine depositional environments and biota (Fisher,
1980; Lorenzen, 1973; Sporleder, 1987; Stewart, 1963, p. 12) as well
as important regional and local effects on overall sequence thicknesses and lithologies (Eccles, 1981; Merriam, 1963, p. 98-101, 107112, 118-119). Similar apparent Pennsylvanian and Permian lithotectonic relationships have been suggested elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Watney and Wilson, 1983), although they may have resulted
in part from passive differential compaction over existing structures (Gentile, 1968, 1979, 1984, p. 36; Steeples and Yarger, 1983).

Mesozoic and Tertiary strata are not present over the uplift
within the study area, having either never been deposited, or else,
deposited and subsequently removed. However, studies of overlapping
relations to the north in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa indicate

the Nemaha anticline was again uplifted during the Cretaceous to

early Tertiary Laramide orogeny (Bunker, 1981; Bunker, et al., 1981;
Carlson, 1988). The presence of numerous Cretaceous-age kimberlite
intrusives in close proximity to the uplift (Plate 1) has also been
cited as evidence for renewed tectonic activity during Laramide time
by Chelikowsky (1972), Fenster and Trapp (1982), and Taylor (1950).
The northwest-southeast orientations of kimberlite outcrops and
their associated magnetic anomalies have been cited as evidence for
emplacement along similarly oriented fractures (Brookins, 1970a,
1970b; Mansker, et al., 1987). Chelikowsky argued on the basis of
these orientations, regional joint trends, and major fault geometries for right-lateral reactivation of the Abilene anticline and
Humboldt fault system in response to east-west directed Laramide
principal horizontal stresses, although the evidence for such an
interpretation is not clearcut (Steeples, 1982, p. 58-59). It does
seem possible that considerable stress could have been transmitted
as far cratonward as north-central Kansas on the basis of Bird's
(1984, Fig. 10) model for Laramide foreland deformation and associated Great Plains crustal thickening. The Chadron-Cambridge arch, a
structurally related uplift of western Nebraska and northern Kansas
(Figure 6), was apparently rejuvenated as recently as the Pliocene
and Pleistocene (Stanley and Wayne, 1972).

Seismic activity has persisted along the CNARS to the present
time as evidenced by historic earthquake epicenter data (Burchett,

et al., 1983; DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Eccles, 1981) and microquake

records (Steeples, et al., 1987). The modern principal horizontal

stress (PHS) is oriented approximately east-northeast/west-southwest

20

throughout much of the Midcontinent according to regional well-bore
breakout data, earthquake fault-plane solutions, and various

measures of in-situ stress (Dart, 1987; Zoback and Zoback, 1980).

Faults and Joints

At present, northern Kansas lies within the Prairie Plains
monocline structural province of the central stable region of the
North American craton (Jewett, 1951). Regional dips of a few meters
per kilometer (about 14 feet per mile) or less (<l degree) to the
west are common, although smaller structures can have important
local effects. Only a few surface faults have been recognized
within the Paleozoic rocks of the study area and all are relatively
small in length and vertical displacement (Bruton, 1958; Eccles,
1981; Hooker, 1956; Underwood and Polson, 1987, 1988). Even fewer
surface faults have been mapped previously within Cretaceous strata
of the study area (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962). The Humboldt fault
zone may reach the surface in Nemaha and northeastern Pottawatomie
counties (Du Bois, 1978; Ratcliff, 1957), but this has been disputed
(Seyrafian, 1977). Published studies of subsurface structure in the
vicinity of study area oil and gas fields suggest basement-involved
faulting has played an important role in localizing many of these
accumulations (Curtis, 1960; Smith and Anders, 1951). Berendsen and
others (1988, p. 4) state that Paleozoic reactivation of study area
basement faults resulted in the formation of many Kansas structures.
This is in accordance with the findings of Merriam (1963, p. 227)

that a close correlation exists between the orientations of 99

21

subsurface anticlines (Figure 8A) and 50 suspected subsurface faults
(Figure 8B) in central and northwestern Kansas. Berendsen and Blair
(1986a) utilized subsurface elevations from 3,794 wells to construct
a series of contour maps for six important Paleozoic horizons in
central Kansas, including approximately the southern fourth of the
study area. They mapped a large number of previously named structural features, as well as many unrecognized structures, including
numerous possible subsurface faults. Their maps also show a close
correlation exists between the locations and orientations of faults
and anticlines in central Kansas.

Although joints are the most common fractures observed in the
outcrops of Kansas, they have received only limited study. Prominent regional joint sets striking N.2-4°E. and N.10-14°W. in the
Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation of Hamilton County were remarked
upon by Bass (1926, p. 80). Although not in Kansas, Melton’s (1929)
early work in Oklahoma deserves mention here. He measured approximately 4,000 joint trends in Pennsylvanian and Lower Permian rocks
at 106 localities in central and southeastern Oklahoma. He determined a dominant set strikes N.37°W., correlating closely with the
strike of faults in the eastern Oklahoma "en echelon" fault belt
(Fath, 1920, 1921, p. 150-155), and a less prominent set strikes
about N.65°E. Neff (1949) compiled a large number of joint orientations for Lower Permian limestones cropping out in each township of
Riley County and determined the existence of a primary set oriented
about N.72°E. and a subsidiary, somewhat variable, set striking

about N.25°W. He postulated that the primary set developed in

response to late Paleozoic northwest-southeast directed tensile
stress, and the secondary set developed differentially in response
to irregularities of local basement structure (i.e. Nemaha and
Abilene anticlines). Nelson (1952) mapped an unstated number of
joint trends in the Permian limestones of Marshall County and determined (p. 31) a major set strikes at N.76°E. and a minor set strikes
at N.15°W. He combined these findings with Neff's (1949) data from
adjacent Riley County in an attempt to determine any influences of
Precambrian basement structures on the surface fracture pattern of
the area. He concluded (p. 54-59) that the joint pattern expressed
at the present land surface reflects an "upward transmission and
progressive rotation" of a much older basement joint pattern.

Wagner (1961) used low-altitude aerial photos to map joint
traces in Upper Pennsylvanian limestones and sandstones over much of
Wilson County and recorded two general groups of N.55°E. and N.35°W.
Stewart (1962) used a similar method to map 10,065 fracture (joint)
traces in northern Cleveland County, central Oklahoma (due south of
Sumner County, Kansas). He demonstrated a prominent set oriented at
about N.49°E. and a secondary mode at about N.24°W. Later Stewart
(1967) recorded 881 joint orientations on outcrops of four Upper
Pennsylvanian limestones of Atchison, Jefferson, Douglas, and Osage
counties. He documented a dominant set of "shear" joints trending
N.60°E., a less common set of tension joints trending N.35°W., and a
third set of short, tight joints trending about N.3°E. Ward (1968)
measured the orientations of 5,777 joints in Upper Pennsylvanian and

Lower Permian limestone outcrops of Butler, Cowley, Greenwood,

24
Chase, and Marion counties. He found two prominent sets with orientations that also average N.60°E. and N.35°W. He stated (p. 21-22)
that no correlation was apparent between the orientations of joints
and underlying faults, the joints were post-Early Permian and preEarly Cretaceous in age, and they may have formed as a result of
northwest-southeast directed horizontal compressive stress generated
during the uplift of the Ouchita Mountains. Jefferis (1969) measured approximately 320 joint orientations in two Upper Pennsylvanian
limestones of southern Douglas County. He found (p. 20, Fig. 9) two
sets of well developed joints trending about N.63°E. and N.41°W, and
a third set of short and tight joints trending about N.2°W. Hagen
(1972, 1985) mapped the surface traces of 2615 joints in Lower
Permian limestones of Osage and Kay counties in north-central Oklahoma (just south of Cowley County, Kansas) as they might relate to
waterflooding success. He found a "remarkably uniform" major set at
N.70°E. and a much less common mean at N.35°W. DuBois (1978) measured the orientations of an unstated number of joints in Lower
Permian limestones of northestern Nemaha County. She found two
pronounced sets oriented at about N.85°E. and N.35W. Macfarlane
(1979) measured about 180 joints in Lower Permian limestones of
northeastern Morris County. He found (his Plate C) a prominent set
at N.45°E. and a less common set at N.52°W. Hoppie (1980) measured
311 joints on 98 outcrops of the Lower Cretaceous Kiowa Shale and
Lower(?) Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone, and 190 joints from 48 exposures of the Upper Cretaceous Greenhorn Limestone in Ottawa, Cloud,

and Mitchell counties. He found (p. 52, Fig. 12) one well-developed

25

set trending N.83°W. in the Greenhorn Limestone, but no distinct
modes were apparent in data for the older clastic units. He concluded that the joints of the Cretaceous rocks of north-central Kansas
were not formed in the same tectonic province as those in the upper
Paleozoic strata of eastern Kansas. Eccles (1981) documented a few
joint trends in Lower Permian Limestones of western Wabaunsee and
eastern Riley counties. He determined (p. 40) means of N.76°E. and
N.12°W. for joints in Wabaunsee County, and (p. 45) means of N.65°E.
and N.21°W. for Riley County sets.

The most recent studies of Kansas joint orientations and their
possible origins are those of Drees (1974) and Neuhauser (1983,
1986). They measured the orientations of 250 joints in the Upper
Cretaceous Fort Hays Limestone Member of Ellis County and determined
a dominant set strikes N.70°W. and a less prominant set strikes
N.25°E. Neuhauser attributed the formation of these two sets to a
conjugate shear couple developed in response to nearly east-west
directed compressive stress of probable early Tertiary (late-Laramide orogeny) age.

A summary of relevant statistics for each of the foregoing
studies is presented in map form on Figure 9. Each symbol represents a single study, and the orientation and length of each ray
corresponds to the orientation and relative abundance of each joint
set measured in a given study. Note the relative consistancy of the
two sets expressed in Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks, and their
distinct discordance with sets in the Cretaceous strata to the west.

The implication of this finding with respect to the drainage pattern

Drainage Pattern

The drainage pattern of Kansas and its origin represents an
interesting aspect of Kansas geology that has received rather sporadic attention over the years, but little detailed study. At first
glance, the drainage network over much of Kansas appears to demonstrate a "textbook example" of the basic dendritic pattern expected
for areas of flat-lying rocks of fairly uniform lithology (Howard,
1967). However, on closer inspection (Plate 2) it becomes apparent
that certain orientations are more prevalent than others, producing
a distinctly subdendritic to rectangular drainage pattern. This
deviation from purely dentritic suggests some form of structural
control influenced drainage development in Kansas (Morisawa, 1985,
p. 145).

Early works on the relationships between drainage and structure
in Kansas are qualitative to semiquantitative at best. Bass (1928,
1929, p. 17-23) remarked on the pronounced asymmetry of many Kansas
drainage basins and suggested differential weathering effects due to
topographic aspect, rather than structural or tectonic influences,
were the cause. During his study of regional joint systems, Nelson
(1952) noted the distinctly rectangular nature of the drainage
pattern in Riley and Marshall counties. He stated (p. 47) "probably
more than 75 percent of the streams in Riley County show some joint

control." Melton (1959) determined the relative frequencies of

28
drainage orientations in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma and
found that the most abundant stream trends were strongly correlated
with the solar insolation angle (i.e. oriented preferentially northsouth) and secondarily with regional joint patterns. This solar
influence on drainage was most pronounced in lower order basins,
whereas apparent joint effects were strongest on higher order
streams. This conclusion differs somewhat from the findings of
Baehr (1954) who studied drainage and rock structure in three small
drainage basins in Geary and Riley counties, Kansas. Baehr stated
(p. 57) that bedding and joints acted as the primary controls on
headward migration of gullies and minor tributaries cutting the
thick Permian limestones of his study area. He did not attribute
any components to nongeologic (i.e. solar) effects.

Merriam (1955, p. 82) commented briefly on the obvious angularity of drainage patterns in western Kansas and later (Merriam, 1963,
p. 254) suggested a bedrock fracture control. Kirk (1968) noted a
rectilinear pattern existed for much of the drainage pattern of
eastern Kansas. He correlated the prominent stream trends with
surface fractures, basement faults, earthquake epicenter distribution, geophysical anomaly trends, and the location of surface igneous intrusions, but offered no quantitative data in support. Ward
(1968) remarked (p. 15) on the apparent influence of regional joint
sets on both the overall drainage pattern, and the specific locations of many smaller drainageways. Chelikowsky (1972, p. 7) also
mentioned an "angular pattern" to the drainage network of Riley

County which he attributed to the regional joint pattern, but did

29

not offer any data to support this assertion. Hagen (1972, 1985),
during his study of joints in north-central Oklahoma, noticed that
they had apparently exercised a strong control on drainage orientations. He ascribed a less prominent north-south drainage maximum
(Melton’s “solar insolation effect"?) to bedding control and all
minor orientations to "Precambrian shears." McNaughton (1974;

McCauley, et al., 1975) utilized an optical Fourier transform of

Landsat satellite imagery to define dominant stream trends for
several portions of north-central Kansas. They argued that tectonic
influences had produced zones of weakness in the surface strata
along which streams tended to preferentially downcut. Seyrafian
(1977, p. 35-42) examined some straight stream segments during his
study of the Humboldt fault zone in northeastern Pottawatomie County, and concluded that strike-slip faulting might account for their
locations and orientations, although obvious stratigraphic evidence
for faulting was lacking. Berendsen and others (1978) utilized the
linear trends of major eastern Kansas rivers to define structural
lineaments in the Precambrian basement, although they did not state
exactly why this relationship should be true.

More recently, Hoppie (1980) evaluated statistically the possible geologic influences on the morphology, including orientation, of
the Solomon River in north-central Kansas. He concluded that the
orientation of a portion of the river flowing over the Cretaceous
Greenhorn Limestone may have been determined by a well-developed
joint set in this unit, but elsewhere the evidence was inconclusive.

Merriam and Sorensen (1982, Fig. 2) mapped a set of prominent topo
30
inn HN Ne eS LL LATS NAY Rs RU _

graphic lineaments in Elk, Greenwood, and Chautauqua counties,
Kansas, and suggested (p. 3) that they reflect regional basement
fault-block structures.

Most recently, the author (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987) studied the
orientations of 4426 straight drainage segments at three scales
within a large portion of north-central Kansas (including the entire
present study area) in an attempt to clarify this apparent relationship between structure and drainage. A distinct N.0-10°E. drainage
orientation mode (Melton’s (1959) "solar insolation angle" mode?)
occurs in all areas and at all scales examined. However, a satisfactory mechanism (other than "solar insolation") for producing this
trend is still lacking. Among geologic controls, regional joint
trends were most strongly correlated with drainage in small order
drainage basins and regional fold axes correlated best with river
and major stream orientations. Because very few surface faults have
been mapped in this area (see above), correlation between surface
fault trends and drainage orientations was difficult to assess.
However, the finding of Merriam (1963, p. 227) that the orientations
of regional folds in Kansas are strongly correlated with (controlled
by?) regional subsurface fault trends implies that the angular
orientations of many study area rivers and streams were perhaps
determined by subsurface faults, rather than regional joint sets as
previously supposed. This also agrees with a statement of Berendsen
and Blair (1984; 1986a, p. 11) that many suspected central Kansas
subsurface faults have corresponding drainage and topographic

features.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Fracture Detection

A large number of techniques for detecting the locations and
orientations of subsurface fractures exist. These range from geologic methods, such as direct observation of joints and faults in the
field, to a diverse number of geochemical, geophysical, and remote
sensing methods. The suitability of a given technique to a particular application depends on factors such as geologic setting, allowable costs, time considerations, necessary precision in locating
individual fractures, and availablity of supporting information
(Goldstein, 1985).

Among geologic methods, surface studies of fault and joint
orientations have received considerable attention in the past.
Regional joint trends are easily determined from simple outcrop
measurements. Unfortunately, surface joint trends may not reflect
major fracture patterns at depth, (Ludvigson and McAdams, 1980, p.
13). In addition, such studies often contain severe investigatorinduced biases due to improper selection and sampling of outcrops,
and only rarely include important information such as joint spacing
and character (La Pointe and Hudson, 1985). Field mapping may be
useful in defining the locations of major faults, but minor faults
or those with little stratigraphic displacement are easily missed,
particularly in areas with thick vegetative cover or sparse bedrock
exposures. Likewise, in areas where subsurface control is good,

structure mapping can often accurately resolve many fault locations.

Unfortunately, in areas of widely spaced drill hole data, such as
the Salina Basin area of northern Kansas, even major faults may be
impossible to recognize.

Down-hole studies, such as borehole televiewing and "fracturefinder" type electric logging, can also provide absolute measurements on the locations and orientations of individual fractures, but
must be performed on uncased holes soon after drilling. Similarly,
thin-section studies require the acquisition of oriented cores
during drilling. All down-hole methods suffer from very limited
areal resolution.

Among surface geophysical approaches to fracture detection,
potential-field methods such as gravity and magnetic mapping have
received only limited use, primarily because they tend to reveal
only intrabasement discontinuities and lack the ability to resolve
precisely the locations of individual fractures (Lewis and Haeni,
1987). Electromagnetic methods such as earth resistivity and Very
Low Frequency (VLF) radiowave surveys have been used to detect
subsurface fractures with varying success (Anderson, 1981; Crumpton
and Badgley, 1959; Steele, 1982), but are time-consuming and of
limited applicablity. In regions with fairly high levels of seismicity, for example southern California and Missouri's New Madrid
area, plotting accurately-located earthquake epicenters may produce
alignments that can be related to fracture locations with some
certainty. One of the more widely used methods for mapping natural
fracture systems is high-resolution reflection seismic data (Till
man, 1983, p. 165). Unfortunately, seismic studies suffer from

33
fairly high acquisition and processing costs and the inability to
resolve fractures along which little or no vertical movement has

occured (Aguilera, 1980).

Lineament Analysis

One of the most widely used and almost universally accepted
approaches to mapping fracture locations and orientations is lineament analysis of topographic maps, potential-field geophysical data,
and remotely sensed imagery. In spite of this widespread acceptance
and use, the terminology of lineament analysis is little agreed upon
and has undergone many changes since the time Hobbs (1904, 1911)
first described linear topographic alignments in the landscape of
the northeastern United States. In this paper I will follow the
general definition of a lineament as set forth by Caran and others
(1981) as "a figure that is perceived in an image or other factual
representation of a solid planetary body that is linear and continuous, has definable end points and lateral boundaries, has a relatively high length to width ratio, a descernable azimuth, and is
shown or presumed to correlate with planetary elements whose origin
is geologically controlled." Under this definition, any linear
features perceived on topographic maps, visible or infrared spectral
data (eg. aerialphotos or Landsat satellite images) or any linear
discontinuities on potential-field geophysical data can be termed
lineaments. To reduce confusion somewhat, linear topographic features (including linear stream segments) could be termed “geomorphic

lineaments", linear spectral features could be termed "photolinea
34

ments", and those apparent on geophysical data could be termed
"geophysical lineaments", or more specifically, "gravity lineaments"
and "magnetic lineaments". This is the specific usage followed
herein.

Since the time of Hobbs (1904, 1911) early papers on the subject, geomorphic lineaments and various types of photolineaments
have probably received the most attention as possible indicators of
subsurface fractures (eg. Caran, et al., 1981; Gilluly, 1977; Haman,
1961, 1964). Readily apparent on virtually any topographic map,
aerial photo, or space image of almost any earth terrain (Gay, 1973,
appendix 2), both types lineaments have generally been considered
the surface traces of subsurface fractures of various types. Unfortunately, in many early lineament studies the precise geologic
origin of these lineaments was not addressed or was stated as "unclear". Lineaments were simply mapped and a structural connotation
was assumed with little substantiating data (Anderson, 1981, p. 1).
The apparently limited value of these early investigations (Gilluly,
1977) probably resulted from inadequate study documentation, inconsistent mapping methods, and indiscriminate use of terms such as
"lineation," "lineament," "“photolinear," “linear feature," "“alignment," and "fracture trace," (Caran, et al., 1981; O’Leary and
Friedman, 1978; O'Leary, et al., 1976a, 1976b). Some researchers
could demonstrate good agreement between the trends of shorter
lineaments and the orientations of major (regional) joint sets (eg.

Boyer and McQueen, 1964; Brown, 1961; Dean, et al

— <a ?

1985; Loar,

1985), which strongly suggested a genetic relationship. In other

35

studies a particular linear feature was shown to correspond to a
zone of more intense jointing in the underlying strata (Lattman and
Matzke, 1961) and less often to mappable surface faults (Brown,
1961; Elifrits, 1982; Jefferis, 1969). The largest of linear
features were generally correlated with suspected basement faults
(eg. Dean, et al., 1984; Hughes, 1983; Lattman, 1958; Maughan and
Perry, 1983) and sub-continental sized fracture zones (Wise, 1969).
Salisbury and Merriam (1984) showed that the major Landsat
photolineament orientations present in an area of southeastern Canada and New York with outcropping Precambrian crystalline basement
rocks were also present in adjacent areas where the basement was
overlain by thick lower Paleozoic strata. They suggested that the
tectonic forces responsible for creating these lineaments in both
areas either: 1) post-date the sediments altogether, or 2) that some
other mechanism caused existing pre-Paleozoic lineaments to promulgate upward from the basement subsequent to deposition of the sediments. They favored the latter interpretation. Elsewhere, studies
in terrains covered by Pleistocene glacial deposits and other unconsolidated sediments have indicated bedrock fractures are also represented by corresponding fractures in the overlying deposits and as
photolineaments on images of these areas (DuBois, 1978; Mollard,
1958; Rumsey, 1971; Thumult, 1984). Among the mechanisms that have
been suggested for producing such a upward propagation and surface
expression of deeper fractures are earth tides, earthquakes and
microquakes, plate tectonic compressional and tensional stresses,

earth rotational stresses, and recurrent glacial loading and unload
36
ing (Rumsey, 1971, p. 30-32), and ground-water related processes
(Berger and Aghassy, 1984). Inasmuch as the northeastern portion of
the study area was glaciated during the Pleistocene (Plate 1) and
locations of surface springs and seeps over much of the study area
are probably controlled by near-surface bedrock joints (Donald Whittemore, verbal comm., June 1988), these latter two factors may be
particularly relevant to the present investigation.

Regardless of their precise geologic origin, photolineaments
are now routinely used by geologists for both reconnaissance- level
and detailed structural analysis throughout the world. This is
evidenced by both the abundant literature on geologic applications
of remotely sensed data and an ongoing series of international
conferences dedicated to the study of lineaments in general, of
which seven have been held since 1974 (eg. Gabrielson, et al.,
1983). Regional and local analyses of photolineaments are now
frequently used as an aid in assessing the tectonic structure and
petroleum potential of frontier basins (eg. Halbouty, 1976, 1980;
Moore and Anderson, 1985), targetting areas for mineral exploration
(eg. Halbouty, 1976), locating zones of enhanced ground water or
natural gas yields (Cooley, 1984; Jammallo, 1983; Rauch, 1984;
Rodgers and Anderson, 1984), defining fractured zones important to
geothermal energy development (Goldstein, 1985), and predicting
fracture trends that might affect induced fracturing of petroleum
reservoirs and enhanced recovery operations (Alplay, 1969; Hagen,

1985; Shumaker, et al., 1976).

Within Kansas and nearby areas, photolineaments have been

37

mapped on aerialphoto mosaics by Stelljes (1964), on radar imagery
by Jefferis (1969), and on Landsat satellite imagery by Anderson
(1981), Callen (1983, 1985), Cooley (1984, 1986), Dwivedi (1983),
McCauley (1988), McCauley and others (1978), Patton and Manwaring
(1984), Peterson (1979), Podwysocki (1974), Proctor and others
(1979), and Toweh (1978), among others. The tectonic implications
of some of these studies are discussed in the Results section below.

Gravity and magnetic lineaments have also generally been considered to reflect possible basement faults, although the literature
on their analysis is not as numerous as for lineaments on topographic maps and remotely sensed images (Lewis and Haeni, 1987). Many
of the basic principles of gravity and magnetic lineament interpretation are given by Dean and others (1984), Gay (1972), Jammallo
(1983), Ossinger (1983), Peterson (1985a, 1985b), and Rasmussen
(1983), to mention a few. Yarger (1983) mapped aeromagnetic lineaments in Kansas (Figure 10) and considered most of these features
(p. 29) to correspond to unmapped intrabasement faults and other
lithologic discontinuities. Lam (1987) mapped a large number of
gravity lineaments in Kansas (Figure 11) and reached similar conclusions (p. 144) regarding their origin. lLength-weighted azimuthal
histograms ("rose diagrams") of Lam’s eastern Kansas gravity lineaments and Yarger’s eastern Kansas aeromagnetic lineaments are presented here (Figures 12A and 12B respectively). On figures 10 and
11 note a very prominant set of north-northeast-oriented lineaments
in central Kansas (corresponding with the trace of the Midcontinent

rift through Kansas) that produces a distinct mode centered on about

N.30°E. on each respective rose diagram (Figure 12). Note also a
secondary mode centered on about N.50°W. on each rose diagram that
results from a distinct set of northwest-oriented geophysical lineaments in eastern Kansas. Finally, note a third, much less distinct,
east-west mode occurs in the gravity data and possibly in the aeromagnetic data. In a study of detailed gravity and aeromagnetic data
in southeastern Kansas and adjacent Missouri, Adkins-Heljeson and
others (1988) mapped prominent sets of NW-SE and NE-SW-oriented
lineaments and likewise interpreted them to reflect the structural
grain of the basement there.

Increasingly, multi-source integrated studies have been used to
detect and map natural fracture systems. Such studies often rely on
information sources as diverse as lineament analyses of gravity,
magnetic and remotely sensed data; seismic reflection profiles;
drainage-pattern analysis; oil-field distribution, engineering, and
recovery parameters; geochemical anomalies; earthquake epicenter and
focal plane data; surface and subsurface geologic mapping; and
various borehole studies, such as in-situ stress measurements (see
for example Thumult, 1984; Vixo and Bryan, 1984). Berendsen and
others (1978) conducted such an integrated study for eastern Kansas,
including the present study area, but portrayed their results on
small scale maps, severely limiting their utility for subsequent
detailed analysis at a local level. The present investigation is an
attempt at a similar integrated study using much of the same data,
but with the resultant maps presented at a possibly more useful

final scale.

42
Drainage Pattern Analysis

Much of the literature on drainage analysis concerns determination of the nature of structural controls on general drainage development, rather than precise locations or orientations of individual
structures that may have influenced particular stream locations or
trends. Most quantitative drainage pattern studies involve measurement of drainage segment orientation frequencies to determine the
degree of uniformity. In areas of flat-lying homogenous strata,
drainage networks tend to display a nearly uniform distribution of
drainage-segment orientations (Morisawa, 1963). Strong deviations
from such uniformity can be interpreted to reflect the influences of
lithology and structural fabric on drainage development (Flarity,
1978; Morisawa, 1985, p. 164; Schick, 1965). In areas of nonuniform
stream orientations where close agreement exists between drainage
orientation modes and dominant structural trends, such as joint,
fault and fold orientations, it is probable that a high degree of
structural control is reflected by the drainage pattern (Cox and
Harrison, 1979; Judson and Andrews, 1955). This relationship is
usually strongest with higher order drainage segments (Delano, 1977;
Flarity, 1978; Jarvis, 1977). It follows then, that in such areas,
there is a good likelihood that a given straight segment of a particular river or stream oriented close to a structural orientation
mode may indicate the actual surface location of such a feature.
Stated another way, an analysis of straight drainage segments (geomorphic lineaments) in an area of nonuniform drainage orientations

could help reveal the surface traces of individual structural fea
43
tures, such as faults, joints and possibly folds, particularly where
they correspond closely to any independent measures of potential

fracture locations.

Soil Gases and Gas Migration

Surprisingly little has been written regarding the occurrence
and interpretation of nonhydrocarbon gases in soils and the subsurface. Helium is perhaps the most commonly reported nonhydrocarbon
gas targetted by soil geochemical surveys. Regional helium soil gas
surveys are generally conducted in an effort to locate oil and gas
fields, uranium and thorium deposits, or geothermal energy fields
(eg. Cunningham, 1987; Cunningham, et al., 1987; Gole and Butt,
1985; Jones and Drozd, 1983; Pogorski and Quirt, 1980). Hydrogen
determinations are occasionally incorporated in soil gas surveys
related to petroleum exploration (eg. Nechayeva, 1968; Rodgers and
Anderson, 1984), but opinions differ on anomaly interpretation.
Sato and others (1984, p. 377) state that site characteristics, such
as local geomorphology and geology, that must be considered in
interpreting anomaly magnitudes. The potential for contamination
from near-surface biogenic sources of hydrogen has also been suggested as a limitation on its utility as an exploration technique (Gole
and Butt, 1985), but the soil-gas work and global hydrogen-budget
models of Conrad and Seiler (1985) indicate that most soils, in
fact, form a sink (not source) for hydrogen, and account for the
annual destruction of up to 95% of the tropospheric hydrogen. Some

hydrogen soil gas anomalies have been shown to correspond with the

4d
surface traces of active faults (Jones and Drozd, 1983, p. 942;

Wakita, et al., 1980; Ware, et

al., 1984) and nondiurnal temporal
fluctuations in soil gas hydrogen concentrations in proximity to
such features have received considerable attention recently as
possible earthquake event predictors (see for example MgGee, et al

—— oa" 3

1983; Satake, et al., 1984; Sato, et al., 1984, 1986; Sugisaki,

1984; Sugisaki, et al., 1983). The precise origin of this "active
fault" hydrogen continues to be debated, but most investigators have
attributed it to either the active shearing of water-rich minerals,
or the release of "pent-up" hydrogen generated by the FeO/hydration
(serpentinization) reaction mentioned above.

Helium and hydrogen, because of their small molecular sizes,
low solubilities in ground water, and low chemical reactivities, are
very mobile gases once generated (Hunt, 1979; McGee, et al., 1983).
They are, therefore, capable of diffusing through all geologic
materials over time, although these diffusion rates are generally
low. Because of this high mobility, they cannot be retained in
traditional geologic traps for long times geologically, and their
presense in deeper subsurface gases (the Heins and Scott wells for
example) implies continuous abiogentic generation at shallow crustal
or deeper levels is taking place (Hunt, 1979; Rodgers and Anderson,
1984, p. 96). Although diffusion rates are generally low, higher
gas-flux rates of several orders of magnitude are predicted for
gases moving upward at depth along faults and fracture zones due to

their fracture-enhanced permeability (Cunningham, et al., 1987, p.

213; Gold and Held, 1987, p. 419; Ware, et al., 1984). High ampli
45

ee ey A el AS 9S 8 AE TT TS

tude, very localized (often single point) helium and hydrogen anomalies detected in soil gas surveys are thus interpreted to reflect
such higher flux rates along near-surface fault zones (Cunninghan,

t al., 1987, p. 213; Driver and Brodine, 1985; Eremeev,

eb ab t al.,

1973; Jones and Drozd 1983; Ovchinnikov, et al., 1972). In addi
tion, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986) reviewed a large number of
subsurface Russian hydrogen occurrences and concluded (p. 126) that
most anomalies occur in association with "zones of deep regional
faults". Angino (1985) pointed out that many of the Kansas soil gas
hydrogen anomalies acquired up until that time (now considered
fairly small) occurred near the centers of river and stream valleys.
McCarthy and others (1986, p. 17) speculated that this association
indicated fault control on the near-surface migration of the Kansas
hydrogen gas. In regional soil gas surveys with sample spacings of
1 to 2 miles (spacings for this study average 0.5 to 1.0 mi.) highly
anomalous values are generally seperated from the statistically less
anomalous background values prior to mapping in order to emphasize
the larger regional trends that may relate to actual petroleum or
other commodity deposit signatures (see for example Cunningham, et
al., 1987). Alternatively, with close enough sample spacing (10-200
feet), the locations of these highly anomalous points can generally
be used to actually map indirectly individual fracture and fault

zones (Roberts and Roen, 1985).

METHODOLOGY

Imagery Analysis

Two general types of remotely sensed imagery were utilized in
this study. These consisted of various Landsat products and lowaltitude airphoto mosaics.

Landsat imagery in three formats was utilized in this study
(Table 1). All images were selected on the basis of minimal cloud
cover conditions, good to excellent image quality, and appropriate
geographic coverage. The band 5 (near infrared) Thematic Mapper
(TM) image dated Jan. 13, 1985 was also selected on the basis of the
superior spatial resolution provided by this sensor and reported
snow-on-ground measurements over the study area. According to the
U.S. Weather Service (verbal comm., 1985) Jan. 10, 1985 snow cover
ranged in thickness from about 44 cm (17 in.) at Concordia in Cloud
County through 30 cm (12 in.) at Milford Lake in Geary County to 20
em (8 in.) at Cottonwood Falls in Chase County. It was felt that
such extensive snow cover and the low sun angle (23 degrees) would
help obscure cultural features and reveal certain, otherwise subtle,
topographic elements (Halbouty, 1976, p. 764; Morrison, 1976). The
band 6 (thermal infrared) TM image dated Aug. 12, 1983 was obtained
because it was felt that the minor drought conditions prevailing
over the study area during the acquisition period would enhance
those areas of anomalous vegetational stress (expressed as leaf
surface temperature) resulting from the increased soil-moisture

conditions expected near lineaments (Berger and Aghassy, 1984; Run

sey, 1971, p. 31-32). ‘The two Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) images were
selected for the high spatial resolution provided by the sensor and
the low sun angle conditions (32 and 44 degrees) during their acquisition dates.

The interpretation procedure for all Landsat image products was
similar to that employed by Anderson (1981, p. 14-19) and Roark
(1985, p. 22-23). A single transparent mylar overlay was attached
to each image and several prominant river junctions or other distinctive landmarks were marked to aid in later registration of all
overlays. Interpreted photolineaments were traced onto these overlays with a "00" Rapidograph ink pen and the aid of a straightedge.
Positive prints were viewed under reflected fluorescent light conditions and transparencies were viewed using the transmitted light of
a commercial fluorescent light table. Viewing was done at both low
and high observation angles in an otherwise darkened room and all
extraneous sources of light were eliminated to reduce eye fatigue.
Various combinations of transparent colored acetate sheets (red,
yellow, green, blue) were utilized to filter both sources of light
(Peterson, 1979, p. 1000). In addition a 79 lines/cm (200
lines/inch) Ronchi ruling was used to aid in the locating of subtle
alignments (Pohn, 1978). Each image was viewed for a period of 10
to 15 minutes (Caran et al., 1981) and reexamined two additional
times on later dates. All linear features were evaluated on airphoto mosaics (see below) to eliminate cultural features. Finally,
all photolineaments observed on two different images, or at least

twice on the same image, were transfered to a final overlay (Plate

49

2) with the aid of an optical enlarging/reducing table.

In addition to photolineaments determined by the above procedure, all linear features mapped in previous Landsat studies overlapping the study area (Callen, 1983; Cooley, 1984; McCauley, et
al., 1978) were reevaluated on the higher resolution imagery available to this study and many of these features also appear on Plate
2. This was done in an attempt to reduce "single-operator bias"
(Podwysocki, et al., 1975; Siegel, 1977).

Black-and-white panchromatic aerial photomosaics of the type
prepared by the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service (ASCS) and its predecessors, the U.S. Commodity Stabilization Service (CSS), the U.S. Production and Marketing Administration
(PMA) and the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA),
acquired between 1938 and 1973, were made available to the author by
the Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Center (KARS), the Remote Sensing
Laboratory (RSL) of the University of Kansas, and the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) for each county of the entire study area. In
spite of some slight inherent geometric distortions, the airphoto
mosaics proved invaluable for evaluating the geomorphic validity
(ie. not cultural effects) and possible geologic causes of Landsatderived features, because these large-scale images were readily
available, and provided both good spectral definition and excellent

spatial resolution (Peterson, 1979, p. 998).

Drainage Analysis

Linear elements of the study area drainage network represent a

50
subset of data derived from an earlier study. Details of the mapping methodology, compilation, and possible interpretations of these
data are available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987). In general,
these data represent a combination of the linear drainage segments
of the study area drainage network as portrayed on the 1,000,000scale U.S. Geological Survey base map of Kansas and the 1:250,000scale U.S. Geological Survey Manhattan and Hutchinson topographic
map sheets. The drainage lines on these maps were originally traced
from aerial photos and are thus portrayed in considerable detail. A
map of these linear segments is not included herein. However, the
drainage network as portrayed on the 1:2500,000-scale maps is available (Plate 2) for comparison with the linear features obtained from

the other data sources.

Gravity Data

Gravity data used in the present study comprise a subset of an
ongoing state-wide gravity survey being conducted by the Kansas
Geological Survey. Within the study area data were acquired by the
Survey over a period of several years using a Worden gravimeter a
stations located every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) or 3.2 km (2.0 mi.) along
east-west transects spaced either 9.6 km (6 mi.) or 6.4 km (4 mi.)
apart respectively (see Lam, 1987, Fig. 6 for actual station locations). These relative gravity measurements were tied into the
International Gravity Standardization Net to establish absolute
gravity values. Earth tide, meter drift, free-air, and Bouguer

corrections were applied using a Bouguer density value of 2.67

51

gm/cm?. Terrain corrections were not performed due to the low
topographic relief of Kansas. Gridding of the data at 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) allowed for spectral domain filtering (see
below) to produce various map products. Estimated overall accuracy
of the final gridded data is thought to be better than 0.5 mgal
(Lam, 1987).

Gravity map products used in this study were produced by digital filtering of an appropriate subset of the Kansas gravity dataset. Filtering operations applied included calculation and removal
of a tenth-order trend surface, as used by Lam (1987, p. 133) to
enhance the contributions of shallow basement sources, and produc
t al.,

tion of two low-angle synthetic illumination images (Yarger,
1984) at "sun" azimuths of 120 degrees (ESE) and 235 degrees (SW) of
north to enhance NNE-trending and NW-trending features respectively
(for state-wide examples of these products see Lam, 1987). The
orientations for these latter two filters were selected on the basis
of two distinct maxima in the orientation plot of Lam’s (1987, Fig.
38) gravity lineaments of eastern Kansas (recompiled: here as Figure
12A). Paper copies and color plots of the resultant images were
plotted at a scale of 1:250,000 using the Kansas Geological Survey's
Versatek plotter and at a scale of 1:1,000,000 with the Survey's
Tektronics color plotter, respectively.

Mylar overlays were then placed over each map and the trends
and lengths of all apparent linear gravity features were traced onto
them. The final map (Plate 3) represents a composite of all linear

features appearing at least twice on these overlays. In addition,

52

“

the linear features of Lam (1987, p. 143, Figure 11 here) were
reevaluated on the study area plots and retraced at the new scale

when considered appropriate.

Aeromagnetic Data

Aeromagnetic data used in this study are part of a high-quality
aeromagnetic survey of the entire state of Kansas completed by the
Kansas Geological Survey between 1975 and 1979. Data were acquired
with an airborne proton-precession magnetometer at a nominal elevation of 762 m (2500 ft.) above sea level along east-west flight
lines with a 3.2 km (2 mi.) spacing and a 2.0 second sample rate.
Resultant measurements were thus spaced about every 0.16 km (0.1
mi.) along track. Data were subsequently regridded to 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) using a nearest neighbor approach and are
believed to be accurate to about 5 nanoteslas (5 gammas). /Yarger
(1981, 1983) gives additional details on acquisition and reduction
of the basic dataset.

The aeromagnetic map products used in the present study were
produced from a subset of the state-wide dataset using existing Fast
Fourier Transform computer routines on the Kansas Geological Survey's Data General computer. Yarger (1981, 1983) utilized the same
algorithms to produce a set of digital images for interpreting the
gross features of the state’s magnetic field. Processing procedures
applied in this study included “reduction to the pole", "downward
continuation", "second vertical derivative", and “synthetic illumi
nation" (for state-wide examples of these products see Yarger,

53


1983). Reduction to the pole is used to remove the effect of the
earth’s inclined magnetic pole and thereby improves the resolution
of anomaly locations. Downward continuation is a mathematical procedure to calculate the magnetic field at a specified elevation
below the original measurement plane and has the effect of enhancing
shallow basement anomalies. Since the rock bodies responsible for
these near-surface anomalies are the ones most likely to have produced structural deformation in the overlying strata, this operation
was applied to the data. Magnetic data were "downward continued" to
2,000 feet below sea level, the approximate average top of the
Precambrian surface in the study area. The second vertical derivative of the magnetic field is often useful for enhancing nearvertical contacts between materials of differing magnetic properties
(Vacquier, et al., 1951) and was therefore thought to be particularly useful for defining possible intra-basement faults in the study
area. The prominent orientations of eastern Kansas linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28) for eastern Kansas (Figure
12B) are strikingly similar to the trends of eastern Kansas gravity
lineaments (Figure 12A) as mapped by Lam (1987, p. 147). Therefore,
synthetic illumination using the same "sun angles" as in the gravity
processing (see above), was used to enhance study area magnetic
features.

A similar set of contour and color plots was again obtained and
a series of mylar overlays were prepared by tracing all lines representing linear magnetic features onto them. The final map of magne
tic lineaments (Plate 3) also represents a composite of linements

54
observed on two or more images. Here again, those linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28, Figure 10 here) in the study
area were also reevaluated and many were retraced onto the final

overlay at the new scale.

Earthquake Foci Data

Data on earthquake and microquake epicenter locations used in
this study (Tables 2 and 3 respectively) were taken from published
sources (DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Steeples, et al., 1987) and recent
unpublished data on file at the Kansas Geological Survey (Greg
Hildebrand, written comm., May 6, 1988). Historic earthquake epicenter data of DuBois and Wilson was originally compiled from written descriptions by earthquake witnesses and damage accounts, and
are presented in Modified Mercalli magnitudes. Because of the
somewhat subjective and imprecise nature of these records, epicenter
locations as plotted (Plate 1) may be subject to considerable locational error. Microquake data has been acquired by a local seismograph network only since 1977 and event magnitudes are recorded in
Richter scale units. Epicenters of these events are located with
greater precision. A discussion of root-mean-squared locational
errors and estimated focal depths is available elsewhere (Steeples,

et al., 1987). Relative to the interpretation of distinct clusters

of epicentral locations (Plate 1), Steeples (1982) has stated (p.
73) that “the trends of microquake activity [in Kansas] define zones

in the basement, where sufficient fault-related permeability might

exist to allow the circulation of fluids from the deep crust."

structural Information

Prior to drafting Plate 4, the author prepared a revised version (not atiown} of Cole’s (1976) and Sims’ (1985) maps of the
Precambrain surface. Well control for this map consisted of about
280 oil and gas tests that penetrated the Precambrian and was taken
primarily from Cole and Watney (1985), with post-1983 data provided
by the University of Kansas, Project Upper Crust (Lanny Lathan,
written comm., May 11, 1988), and the Kansas Geological Survey (Lynn
Watney, written comm., May 13, 1988). In addition to basement
faults mapped by Cole and Sims, the locations of known or suspected
faults mapped in overlying strata (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, Map 6;
Curtis, 1960; Newell, 1987) were extended down to the Precambrain
surface following the assumption of Berendsen and Blair (1986, p. 3)
that "a fault present in a mapped unit must cut the underlying older
rocks as well." On Plate 4 these "probable faults" appear to be
concentrated along the Nemaha uplift because of the fairly high
drilling density there and very limited well control over the remainder of the area. Additionally, linear structural trends on the
revised basement map that could conceivably represent faults were
annotated on this map in much the same fashion as Berendsen and
others (1978, Fig. 3) treated Cole’s (1976) map. Features portrayed
as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4 are thus a composite of
those mapped by Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18, reproduced as
Figure 4 here) and additional basement fractures interpreted in this
study from the above-mentioned basement structure trends, and linea
ments interpreted from geophysical, remotely sensed, drainage, and

58

earthquake foci data (see Discussion section below).

Soil Gas Data

Soil gas measurements used in the present investigation (Plate
1) represent a composite of 190 soil gas hydrogen values obtained by
the U.S. Geological Survey in July, 1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986;
McCauley and Watney, 1984) and an as yet unpublished dataset of just
over 400 measurements acquired since that time by Ernest E. Angino
and coworkers as part of an ongoing study of the Kansas hydrogen
occurrence. Soil gas samples and hydrogen determinations for these
two studies were obtained by different techniques.

The procedure used by the U.S. Geological Survey has been
described in considerable detail by McCarthy and others (1986, p.
9). In general, it consisted of driving a 0.75 m (2.5 ft.) long

(0.3 in?) gas

hollow steel probe in the soil, withdrawing a 5 cm
sample with a syringe, and analyzing it immediately in a truckmounted mass spectrometer. This uncalibrated procedure produced
measurements of relative hydrogen concentration only. Values reported here as "small anomalies" and "medium anomalies" on Plate 4 from
this dataset are those considered "possible anomalies" and "anomalies" by McCauley and Watney (1984, Fig. 5B, 10) on the basis of
degree of positive deviation from their daily (downward) trends.
The very shallow nature of their sampling depth probably produced
considerable diurnal variations in hydrogen concentrations (Gole and

Butt, 1985, p. 2112; Sato, et al., 1986, p. 12,321) which they

apparently did not attempt to account for. The deeper sampling of

59

the Angino group was an attempt to overcome this problem.

The methodology of Angino and coworkers has not been previously
described and is outlined here (Ernest E. Angino, verbal comm., May
27, 1988). Trailer or truck-mounted power soil augers were used to
drill 5 cm (2 in.) diameter holes to average depths of about 3 m (10
ft.) [actual range = 2-4.5 m (6-14 ft.)] at locations on private
lands spaced about every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) [locally 0.8 km (0.5 mi.)]
along sample traverse roads (Plate 1). Holes were cased with conmercially available 5 cm (2 in.) diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipes of an appropriate length. PVC pipes had been slotted on the
lower 60 cm (2 ft.) and were fitted on the top with a septunequipted PVC end cap. Pipes were pumped to partial vacuum and left
undisturbed for a period of about 15 minutes, allowing soil gasses
to collect within the pipes. Gas samples were then withdrawn
through the septa with a 100 cm? (6.0 in.?) syringe and analyzed
immediately in portable gas chromatographs. 269 analyses were performed prior to the 1987 field year and utilized a Hewlett Packard
5890A model gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector
and a 1 meter capillary column. This technique produced only relative measurements of soil gas hydrogen concentrations (sample locations indicated as "Relative Values" on Plate 1). Gas analyses
performed since that time utilized a field-ruggedized, HNU Series
301 model portable gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity
detector and a 4 meter capillary column. Alternate analyses of 100
cm? (6.0 in.) samples of a calibrated gas standard (stated concen
trations of 1000 ppm + 1% Hy, 500 ppm +1% He) during this latter

60

cs

period allowed absolute determinations of 135 hydrogen concentrations to be made (sample locations marked “Absolute Values" on Plate
1). Sdhsequent vesenp ling of some of the older, "relative" stations
empirically demonstrated a nearly linear relationship existed between the two types of measurements.

To facilitate comparison of hydrogen anomaly magnitudes from
these two sources, highly anomalous measurements were grouped into 4
relative classes in an approach that differs slightly from that of
Cunningham and others (1987, p. 218). The population means and
standard deviations of each group ("Relative Values", and "Absolute
Values") were determined seperately (Figure 13), and all values
exceeding the mean for the data type were considered anomalous for
mapping purposes. All measurements below the mean for each data
type were considered to represent a regional "background" population
(although quite high by global standards, see for example Ware, et
al., 1984), and are portrayed on Plate 4 accordingly. Measurements
between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and those greater than 3 standard
deviations above the population mean for each respective group are
portrayed on Plate 4 as "small", "medium", and "large" anomalies
respectively. Interestingly, 32% of the values of each group exceed
the corresponding means and are thus considered anomalous. This may
be an indication that both populations represent statistically valid
samples of a single population in spite of slightly different gas

sampling procedures and analytical techniques.

RESULTS

Drainage Analysis

Analysis of drainage network maps for that portion of Kansas
lying between 38 an 40 degrees north latitude and 96 and 98 degrees
west longitude (including all of the present study area) was completed at an early stage in this investigation and resulted in the
delineation of 644 linear stream segments totaling 6023 km (3743
mi.) in length from all drainage basins exceeding 10 kin? (3.9 mi.)
in area. A more detailed discussion of the results from this analySis is available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987), but, in general,
the correlation of the single broad north-south mode in this data
with known geologic controls was found to be poor. Nonetheless, a
length-weighted azimuthal histogram ("rose diagram") has been compiled in 10 degree increments from the linear drainage segments
mapped during that investigation and is included here (Figure 14B)
for comparison with other linear feature data.

Length-weighted values, as opposed to simple orientation frequencies, were utilized in compiling the drainage rose diagram, and
all subsequent diagrams, because this approach permits direct quantitative comparisons of orientation tendencies for many data types
to be made, regardless of sample size. In addition, correlation
coefficients between linear-feature orientation frequency and cummulative length for each data type are all slightly positive (eg. for
drainage alignments, r = +0.11), indicating that those linear fea
tures possessing the more abundant orientations also tend to be

63

slightly longer. These two factors (length-weighting, and positive
length/frequency correlations) are additive and thus tend to produce
fairly "spikey" rose diagrams. Note also that the radial scales (in
percentage by length) of these diagrams vary from figure to figure
in order to portray the maximum rays of each diagram at approximately similar physical lengths, further facilitating comparison of
the different types of data. During examination of these rose
diagrams, the reader should bear in mind that a truly random distribution of linear element orientations would statistically tend to
produce a rose diagram with all 18 rays of approximately 5.6% in
length (100% / 18 rays = 5.6% / ray).
Imagery Analysis

Analysis of study area Landsat imagery produced a sompogite of
242 straight or nearly straight photolineaments totaling 2132 km
(1325 mi.) in length and 50 distinctly curved photolineaments.
Comparison of these photolineaments with the drainage network (Plate
2) shows that almost all photolineaments of both types correspond to
linear or semicircular drainage features respectively. This finding
concurs with most previous studies reported in the literature.
Given that most of these features correspond with surface drainage
elements, the locations of which are precisely defined, both the
locational accuracy and orientational precision of these features
are considered very good. Some of the strongly curved photolineaments ("curvilineaments" of some other authors) also appear to
correlate with structural domes, horsts, or grabens as mapped by

Berendsen and Blair (1986), and Cole (1976) along the Nemaha anti
65

cline, and, to a lesser degree, with circular aeromagnetic (Yarger,
et al., 1981) or gravity (Yarger, et al., 1985) anomalies. Other
than these general observations, further analysis of the possible
tectonic significance of curved photolineaments was not attempted.

Cursory examination of Plate 2 reveals that two fairly distinct
azimuthal modes are present in the straight photolineament data.
These trends have been quantified with a length-weighted rose diagram (Figure 14A) of their orientations. Because of the obvious
difficulties and dubious value in determining average azimuthal
values for the strongly curved photolineaments, these features have
been excluded from this compilation. One wide, but fairly distinct,
mode occurs at about N.10°E. A less prominant and narrower mode
occurs at about N.40°W. Note that neither of these modal orientations agrees well with any of the well-documented regional joint
trends (N.60-75°E., N.10-35°W., and N.70-83°W.) of the eastern
Kansas-Oklahoma area as discussed above.

This bimodal distribution of study area photolineaments resembles fairly closely the results of Anderson's (1981, Fig. 7b) study
of Landsat photolineaments in an adjoining area of southeastern
Nebraska, although his modes appear to be offset clockwise by about
20 and 10 degrees respectively. In addition, he interpreted (p. 19)
a broad northeastern maximum to represent a composite of two narrower modes. From extensive comparisons with many possible geologic
causes, he concluded that many of the photolineaments could mark the
surface traces of a periodically rejuvinated regional basement frac
ture system.

66

These two prominant modes at N.40°W. and N.30°E., as well as
two less frequent modal orientations of N.15°W. and N.65-70°E., were
also present in the Landsat photolineaments mapped by Dwivedi
(1983). He attributed both sets of photolineaments to a conjugate
fracture system produced by wrench faulting of the Nemaha anticline
and related structures near his study area in south-central Kansas.
Jefferis (1969, Fig. 10A) also documented a nearly identical N.40°W.
mode and a N.50°E. mode in radar photolineaments from southern Douglas County which he ascribed (p. 31) to "major faults and zones of
fracture concentrations." Callen (1983) mapped a large number of
Landsat photolineaments in the Forest City basin and concluded that
at least two individual features in Atchison, Jefferson, and Leavenworth counties, Kansas, reflected two previously unrecognized northeast and northwest-oriented basement faults. He later (1985) used
several basinwide trend surface maps of mean photolineament azimuths
to infer a distinct influence of the Missouri gravity low on the
structural development of the basin.

Orientation statistics have apparently never been compiled for
the remainder of the major photolineament studies in Kansas (Cooley,
1984, 1986; McCauley, 1988; McCauley, et al., 1978; Podwysocki,
1974), but visual examination of each these maps demonstrates that
both the northeast and northwest modes are regionally pervasive.
For example, Cooley (1984) mapped a large number of Landsat photolineaments in western Kansas, and that portion of his map which
overlaps the southwestern corner of the study area is presented here

(Figure 15). Note that, although photolineaments with virtually

67

every orientation are present, north-northeast and northwest-oriented features are much more abundant and tend to be considerably
longer than the others. Although it is fairly obvious that not
every single one of the photolineaments he mapped corresponds to an
actual geologic or structural feature, it is apparent that a nonrandom componant is certainly present and it does at least seem likely

that it could reflect such a genetic origin.

Gravity and Magnetic Features

Upon initial examination of Plate 3 it is readily apparent that
two prominant orientations also exist for both types of linear
geophysical elements mapped. Compilations of the 71 gravity lineaments totaling 1687 km (1048 mi.) in length , and 94 magnetic lineaments 2560 km (1591 mi.) in cumulative length (Figure 16) appearing
on this map serve to clarify these two prominant modes. These modes
are nearly identical in both orientation and magnitude on both rose
diagrams, and correlate well with the modes determined by Lam (1987)
for gravity and Yarger (1983) for aeromagnetic lineaments in eastern
Kansas (Figure 12). They are also remarkably similar to the modes
determined for photolineaments above. Given the reasonable spatial
resolution of the original aeromagnetic data (see Methodology section), the locational and orientational precisions of the magnetic
features are considered fairly good, although not as good as photolineament data. However, the wide spacing of gravity stations over
most of the study area (see Methodology section) probably degraded

gravity feature locational and, to a lesser extent, orientational

69

od

accuracies considerably.

With closer examination of Plates 2 and 3, it becomes apparent
that the patterns of linear features in the northwestern half of
each map differ somewhat from those present in the southeastern
halves. A more-or-less distinct discontinuity between these patterns appears to correspond with the location of the eastern flank
of the Abilene anticline. Additional rose diagrams have thus been
compiled for Landsat (Figure 17), gravity (Figure 18), and magnetic
(Figure 19) features with respect to whether they have been mapped
northwest of, or southeast of, the Abilene anticline. Although both
of the prominant modes mentioned above are still apparent in both
gravity and magnetic trends, their relative importance is reversed
across the Abilene structure. Northwest-oriented geophysical features predominate in the eastern portion of the maps, whereas northnortheast trending features are considerably more abundant to the
west. This is also true for Landsat photolineaments, but the northnortheast mode has shifted to nearly due north for photolineaments
in the western half of Plate 2. The possible significance of this

shift is not understood.

Basement Structure

The 49 linear features, totaling 1505 km (935 mi.) in length,
mapped on the revised contour map of basement configuration (see
Methodology section) are shown on Plate 3 and their orientations are
compiled on Figure 20A. Again note a prominant mode centered on

N.30-40°E. and a very small secondary mode at about N.50°W.

71

DISCUSSION

Structural Interpretations

In general, with the possible exception of drainage trends,
each of the foregoing compilations of data appears distinctly bimodal, with prominant modes at about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This
close correlation of orientation statistics for linear features
extracted from such widely differing basic data sources [ie. certain
river and stream orientations (linear drainage segments) and areal
spectral reflectance characteristics (Landsat photolineaments),
areal variations in rock magnetic properties (magnetic lineaments)
and rock density (gravity lineaments), and basement surface configuration (linear structural trends)] implies a similar genetic cause.
Comparison of these features with the locations (Plate 4) and orientations (Figure 20B) of the 73 probable study area faults as
previously mapped using subsurface data by Berendsen and Blair
(1986) and Newell (1987) indicates a close correlation exists here
also, again implying a causal relationship. Many of the gravity and
magnetic linear features mapped elsewhere in Kansas are thought to
correspond in both orientation and location with basement discontinuities controlled by faults and anticlines (see Introduction and
Methodology sections above). Therefore, I suggest that the two
prominant modes for linear features in the structural, geophysical,
and remotely sensed data sets of the study area also reflect a
bimodal basement fracture and fault system. Thus, all features por
trayed as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4, with the excep
76
[r/c crvere sas vere ae armenian cuit tatters casa asada deaiaascainsiasnsmasmassmcmmmccmmmmcccamamcma a ——————__ LL La ll al —l—aalP-_— —_

tion those modified after Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18,
presented here as Figure 4 in Introduction section), have been
inferred on the basis of linear features on recorded on Plates 2 and
3. In general, the locations of most of these "possible faults or
fractures" were interpreted from any combination of spatially coincident gravity lineaments, aeromagnetic lineaments, structural lineaments, linear drainage segments, or Landsat photolineaments. Some
were inferred on the basis of aeromagnetic lineaments alone, particularly those oriented either NW or NNE, and a few represent linear
features that correlated well with the extensions of previously
mapped subsurface faults. A discussion of each feature and contributing data sources would be too lengthy to include here, so the
reader is urged to consult the source maps (Plates 2, and 3) for the
following discussion and during evaluation of the interpretative map
(Plate 4).

Many, perhaps most, of the northwest-oriented fractures in the
eastern portion of Plate 4 are probably genetically related to a set
of similarly oriented basement fault zones previously infered to
exist in the granitic basement over much of eastern Kansas and
western Missouri (Berendsen and Blair, 1984; Berendsen, et al.,
1978; Kisvarsanyi, 1974; McCracken, 1971). One of these, the
Bolivar-Mansfield fault zone (Plate 4), appears to intersect the
Nemaha anticline in a structurally complex portion near southeast
Riley County and continues westward through the Abilene anticline
very close to several of the Riley County kimberlites (Berendsen, et

al., 1988, p. 16). These northwest-oriented fractures parallel the

77

~

bounding faults of the Missouri gravity low and it seems possible
that this fault set could represent a Phanerozoic structural event
imposed. on the basement rocks of the region, or could have
originated from tensional fracturing of the upper crust during the
middle? Proterozoic (>1,350 to 1,485 Ma) tectonic event thought to
be responsible for producing the Missouri gravity low. It also
seems possible that the locations and orientations of these faults,
as well as the overall trend of the Missouri gravity low, may
reflect regionally pervasive set of even older crustal weaknesses.
These weaknesses could also have resulted from the roughly dated
(1,800 to 1,400 Ma ?) middle Proterozoic shearing episode discussed
above (see Introduction section), or could conceivably have been
incurred even earlier during early Proterozoic accretion of the
Central Plains province itself (Bickford, et al., 1986, p. 494).
Yarger (1983, p. 27) has stated that most of the northwest-oriented
aeromagnetic features of eastern are interupted at the rift by the
north-northeast features which characterize this zone, implying that
"the northwest grain is older than the rift." Alternatively, the
mechanism which produced the northwest set could postdate formation
of the rift and have simply failed to produce many of these features
within the preexisting rift zone.

Likewise, many of the inferred north-northeast oriented
fractures, so pervasive along the Nemaha anticline and west of the
Abilene anticline, probably correspond with basement fault zones
trending parallel to the Midcontinent rift system axial zone and may

have resulted from tensional stresses associated with middle Proter
78

ozoic (about 1,100 to 950 Ma) formation of this rift, although they
too may reflect earlier crustal anisotropy.

The. north-northeast-oriented fractures show an apparent tendency (Plate 4) to be expressed as zones of fairly closely spaced
fractures (notably the Nemaha and Abilene anticlines, Washington
structure, and possibly the Belleville fault) seperated by wide
areas of relatively unfractured basement. Of these four zones, two
(Nemaha and Belleville) are spatially coincident with abundant historic seismic activity (Plate 1). The former is expressed by over
1,000 m (3,000 ft.) of vertical Phanerozoic fault displacement and
the latter corresponds with the traditionally mapped western limit
of the Rice Formation (Bickford, et al., 1979). The other two
features (Abilene and Washington) have been interpreted as _ the
eastern and western boundaries of rift-related mafic basement rocks
respectively (eg. see Bickford, et al., 1979), and correspond with

both the steepest gradients on the central gravity high of Bouguer

t al., 1985) and distinct discontinuities

gravity maps (eg. Yarger,
on aeromagnetic images of the study area (eg. Yarger, et al., 1981).
In addition, the Abilene anticline was observed (see Results section) to mark the boundary between two distinct areas of linearfeature characteristics, but shows only about 100 m (300 ft.) of
Phanerozoic vertical displacement.

I believe these latter two features (Abilene and Washington)
reflect deep crustal zones that acted as fundamental controls on the

location and structure of the rift zone during extension, including

magma intrusion and extrusion, but are no longer very active tecton
79
ically (as shown structurally and seismically), perhaps because of
"healing" by the extensive rift-related magmatism. The proximity of
the Riley County (Cretaceous age) kimberlites to the Abilene anticline could reflect this deep crustal fracturing. The other two
features (Nemaha and Belleville) could have acted as important
controls on rift-basin and post-rift basement geometry, affecting
the locations of the "east Rice basin" and "west Rice basin", but
were sufficiently distal from active rift magmatism that they have
remained zones of deep crustal weakness through the present.

Taken together these two infered fault sets comprise a well
defined "gridded fault pattern" similar to that proposed for the
northern portion of the Midcontinent rift in Michigan, Minnesota,
and Wisconsin (McSwiggen, et al., 1987; Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985)
and typical of continental rifts in general (Ramberg and Smithson,
1975). This bimodal fracture system could segment the upper crust
of northern Kansas into large orthogonal blocks, as has been suggested for elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Zabawa, 1978). It is
probable, given the relatively thin cover of Phanerozoic sediments
relative to the thick Precambrian crust, that such a pervasive
system of deep fractures (particularly the unhealed rift marginal
sets) could have been periodically reactivated by external tectonic
stresses through time (Ford, 1983). Theoretically at least, the
orientation of any individual fracture plane relative to these
stresses would determine the style of deformation (normal, reverse,
strike-slip, or a combination thereof) associated with any rejuvina
tion event (Peterson, 1985a, 1985b). The complex fault geometries

80

and horst/graben structures presently associated with some of these
fault zones (eg. Humboldt fault zone) may represent near-surface
fault splays resulting from several episodes of convergent wrench
movement along the deeply seated (possibly listric) rift-marginal
master faults (see Wilcox, et al ., 1973, Fig. 15; Zabawa, 1978,
Fig. 27). Episodic reactivation of such zones could also have
produced differential uplift or downdropping of larger crustal
blocks, causing local paleobathymetric and paleotopographic relief
(Gustavson, 1983). Such irregularities might have resulted in important lithologic and structural trends in the overlying Phanerozoic sedimentary package, particularly in water-depth sensitive
near-shore settings (see Introduction section). With adequate constraints on paleostress fields and fracture orientations it might be
possible to predict deformational styles and related lithostratigraphic influences (including petroleum trapping potential) in the
Phanerozoic rocks of the poorly explored, deeper portions of the
Salina basin (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4; Newell, et al., 1988b).
Conversely, in areas of sufficient control, such as along certain
portions of the Nemaha structure, consideration of fault plane
geometries and associated lithotectonic expressions of deformational
styles could perhaps serve to confirm or refute reconstructions of
regional paleostress fields.

The spatial proximity of modern seismicity (Plate 1) to many of
these supposed faults (Humboldt fault zone, Belleville fault, and,
of particular note, the Poersch fault) strongly suggests that move
ment continues along at least some of them at present. Such activi
81

ty could be responsible for propagating these fracture zones upward
to the present land surface, perhaps in the form of zones of more
intense jointing or more rarely as actual faults with stratigraphic
offsets, where they are now expressed as modern drainage alignments
and photolineaments. The overall lack of resistant beds in the
Wellington Formation and the resultant paucity of outcrops over much
of the central portion of the study area (where the largest hydrogen
anomalies occur) precluded evaluation of this hypothesis in the
field using a suitable approach for detecting such zones (for example see Wheeler and Dixon, 1980).

If such intensely jointed zones do exist, however, they could
theoretically provide enhanced permeability pathways for vertically
moving free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. It is also likely
that their ages and tectonic history could have produced different
internal geometries, thereby affecting relative permeabilities
(Schrauf and Evans, 1984). Furthermore, their three dimensional
orientations relative to the modern horizontal stress field should
profoundly influence their fluid conductivity characteristics (Merin
and Moore, 1986). Internal geometry factors (age, genetic origin,
etc.) being equal, those fracture zones oriented subparallel with
the modern principal horizontal stress (ie. approximately eastnortheast) would be expected to be the most "open" to vertically

migrating fluids.

Visual inspection of the locations of linear features (Plates 2

82
~
and 3), infered fractures (Plate 4), and anomolous soil gas samples
(Plate 4) reveals that many of the "medium," "large," and "very
large" hydrogen anomalies occur on, very near, or along the extensions of linear features and suspected fractures. Of particular
note are several anomalies located along the two infered faults
bounding the northern extension of the Lindsborg anticline, numerous
anomalies along the Chapman Creek fracture, and several anomalies
(including the largest “relative" sample of all) located near the
Poersch fault mentioned above. Additional examples could be cited.
Some "small" anomalies also appear to be spatially correlated with
such features. Given the large sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0 mi.),
these findings are somewhat surprising, and suggest a slightly positive correlation may exist between anomaly magnitudes and their
relative proximities to linear features in spite of the coarse sample spacing. However, note that a large number of nonanomalous
values also occur close to linear features. This relationship has
been noted in other studies. Richers and others (1986, Fig. 13)
provided a hypothetical fracture model that can account for these
observations (Figure 21 here). Additional soil-gas sampling at
close intervals (50 to 200 ft.) across one or more of the above
mentioned specific features might serve as a test of the model in
Kansas. Sampling across the trace of a surface fault documented in
Ottawa County (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962) that parallels the inferred
northwest-oriented fracture set, and might help establish the relative importance of actual fault zones as hydrogen conduits (Ware, et

al., 1984) for the Kansas occurrence. Smoothed regional trends of

t al., 1988) are probably more

soil gas hydrogen values (Angino,
likely to reflect the gross geometry of deep source areas or zones,
than localized near-surface transportation routes.

I believe that the apparent correlation between fracture locations and hydrogen soil-gas anomaly magnitudes, however slight, does
reflect vertical movement of the gas through basement fault and
fracture zones into corresponding (implied, but as yet undocumented)
near-surface fracture zones. Probably the most accurate, and perhaps only, way to verify the existance and nature of these infered
fracture zones, to quantify their various permeability factors, and
determine their relative importance as hydrogen conduits would be to
actually penetrate several of these zones with appropriately located
boreholes utilizing deviated drilling techniques (Figure 22), and
perform relevant core analyses and drillstem tests. Among the particular features to be recomended for such testing at this point are
the inferred Chapman Creek fracture zone, faults flanking the Lindsborg anticline (eg. Salina fault), the Poersch fault, and any other
pronounced anomaly/linear feature combinations detected by additional soil-gas sampling. Assuming such zones were penetrated and
showed evidence of substantially enhanced hydrogen movement, determination of the presence or absence of a reasonably hydrogen-impermeable sealing horizon (salt?, bentonitic shale?) could affect the
potential exploitability of the occurrence. And finally, if the
viability of a hydrogen resource could be demonstrated, additional
reconnaissance-level soil-gas sampling and down-hole testing along

much of the Midcontinent rift system might be warranted.

CONCLUSIONS

Fracture Pattern

The Precambrian basement rocks of the study area are typified
by a bimodally distributed fracture pattern with modal orientations
close to N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This bimodal fracture pattern is
expressed as linear trends in gravity and aeromagnetic data, earthquake foci locations, structural surfaces, kimberlite axes, and as
stratigraphic offsets in seismic data. Surficial indications of it,
such as drainage alignments and spatial variations in spectral
response as detected by Landsat (ie. photolineaments), may reflect
zones of increased near-surface joint intensity over deeper fault
zones.

The northwest-oriented fracture set is apparently the older set
and may date from tensional forces associated with middle(?) Proterozoic formation of the Missouri gravity low or perhaps earlier
accretion of the Central Plains orogen. The north-northeast fracture set probably resulted from axial-parallel normal faulting in
response to tensional stresses during Keewenawan age rifting of the
Midcontinent rift system, but it is also possible that both the
gross rift trend and subsidiary fault locations may also have been
largely controlled by older crustal weaknesses.

This bimodal fracture pattern has been periodically reactivated
differentially throughout Phanerozoic time in response to changes in
crustal stress regimes, due primarily to plate tectonic interactions

at the North American continental margins. This periodic reactiva
86

~

tion is expressed as progressive-displacement-through-time (growth)
faults, fault-proximal Paleozoic lithology and thickness changes,
localized Cretaceous intrusive activity, and modern seismicity. The
styles of movement along particular fractures have changed variously
with geologic time and this is probably a function of fracture plane
orientation and principal stress direction. Nearby tectonic events
(eg. Ouchita orogeny, Laramide orogeny) have produced major local
effects and well-constrained paleostress directions for these events
may permit predictive modeling of resultant deformation styles on
the basis of fracture orientations in areas of poor subsurface control (Salina basin for example). Parallel sets of through-going
fractures (Belleville and Nemaha fault zones) could also have acted
as conjugate shear couples, resulting in local reorientation of the
principal horizontal stress, complicating this interpretation procedure considerably. The origin and tectonic history of a given fracture has probably influenced its internal geometry and intrinsic
permeability characteristics. The modern principal horizontal
stress in the Midcontinent is oriented approximately east-northeastwest-southwest. Fracture-geometry considerations aside, knowledge
of subsurface stress orientations might permit predictions of the
relative "openness" (net permeability) of individual fractures or

fracture sets, such as might affect intrafracture fluid movement.

Soil Gas Relations

Hydrogen detected in soil gases undoubtly originates below the

Phanerozoic-Precambrian interface, perhaps from the active serpenti
87

nization of rift-related mafic rocks, perhaps from deep circulation
and mixing of different formation waters, perhaps from deep-crustal
or mantle outgassing. It almost certainly moves vertically primarily through fractures, either dissolved in formation fluids or as
free gas. The present soil-gas sample density is probably insufficient to delineate, with any degree of certainty, the individual
near-surface fracture zones acting as these possible conduits.
Evaluation of the viability of potential future exploitation of
the hydrogen probably hinges on very accurate delineation of the
major fracture zones through which hydrogen could be moving (not
possible in this study due to inadequate data source resolutions),
the presence of suitable sealing horizons (salt?, bentonitic
shales?), and the use of appropriate well drilling and completion

practices.

Future Research

Suggestions for further research related to the fracture pattern of north-central Kansas, the Midcontinent rift system, and the
Kansas hydrogen occurrences include:

1) Digital processing and reinterpretation of the higher resolution (1 mile by 1 mile nominal station spacing) gravity data
presently being acquired over the study area by the Kansas Geological Survey.

2) Acquisition, enhancement, and interpretation of high resolution, low altitude aeromagnetic data.

3) Installation of additional seismic stations to improve loca
88

tional accuracy and provide a lower event-magnitude detection limit.

4) Acquisition of short, high resolution seismic lines across
the Abilene anticline, Washington structure, or Belleville fault to
determine if Phanerozoic deformation is fault-controlled and the
importance of these structural zones at sub-Phanerozoic levels.

5) Acquisition of closely spaced (50 to 200 feet) soil-gas
hydrogen determinations across those linear features spatially correlated with substantial hydrogen anomalies in the present data set
(eg. Chapman Creek) or known surface faults (eg. Ottawa County) to
test for the presence of inar-sutface enhanced gas-flux effects.

6) Evaluation the possible influence of geomorphic and soil
factors (texture, clay mineralogy, moisture content, etc.) on hydrogen anomaly magnitudes.

7) Determination of hydrogen gas contents of any presently
cased petroleum wells and selected ground water wells in the Clay
County, northern Dickinson County, eastern Ottawa County, and northern Saline County area.

8) Rig-side determination of hydrogen content of gases exsolved
from drilling muds during the drilling of all future petroleum tests
in the vicinity of the Midcontinent rift, both in Kansas and elsewhere along its extent.

9) Targetting of a specific fracture zone for testing, use of
directional drilling to increase probability of fracture intersection, and appropriate core analysis and drill-stem testing.

10) Extension of reconnaissance-level sampling to the north and

west to further define the areal extent of the gas occurrences.

ABSTRACT

Lineament analysis of digitally filtered gravity and aeromagnetic data for that portion of north-central Kansas bounded by
38.5°N. and 40.0°N. latitude and 96.0°W. and 98.0°W. longitude
suggests the basement is characterized by a bimodal set of linear
compositional discontinuities. These discontinuities are interpreted to reflect an intrabasement fracture pattern with modal
orientations of about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. These prefered
orientations are also expressed as linear elements in a revised
contour map of the Precambrian surface configuration, indicating
Phanerozoic movement has taken place along many of them. The northwest-oriented fracture set parallels regional basement fault zones
associated with the Middle Proterozoic(?) Missouri gravity low and
may have resulted from the tensional(?) stresses responsible for
formation of that feature. The north-northeast-oriented set parallels the central axis of the Midcontinent rift system and probably
reflects extensive tensional faulting inferred to have accompanied
the Middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) rifting. Alternatively, both
sets could reflect even older upper-crustal anisotropy. Clustering
of historic earthquake and recent microquake epicenters around
several of these fracture zones demonstrates that some are still
active. Such recurrent seismicity, perhaps in combination with
differential isostatic rebound since Pleistocene glaciation, could
provide a mechanism for upward propagation of these zones.

Although surface faults are virtually unknown from the study

area, correlation between the locations and modal orientations of

the inferred basement fractures and both Landsat photolineaments,
and linear drainage segments, is good to fair. This may imply that
many of these fractures are expressed at the present land surface as
zones of preferential weathering, perhaps in the form of linear
zones of increased joint density.

Comparison between the magnitudes of nearly 600 hydrogen soil
gas measurements and their relative proximity to these suspected
fractures indicates that at least some of these zones may extend to
the present land surface and act as preferential conduits for vertical migration of free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. However,
it is concluded that the present soil-gas sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0
mi.) is too coarse to accurately define the exact surface traces of
these fractures. The viability of future exploitation of the hydrogen is still unknown, but will probably depend on more precise
definition of these zones, the presence of a suitable trapping
mechanism, and drilling and completion practices appropriate for the

occurrence.

INTRODUCTION

Background Information

In 1982, unusually high concentrations of free hydrogen (30 to
40 mole %) and nitrogen (60 to 70 mole %) were detected in casinghead gases of the CFA Oil Co. #1 Scott well in northwest Morris

County, Kansas (Goebel, et al., 1983a; 1983b) and the CFA Oil Co. #1

Heins well (Plate 1) in southern Geary County, Kansas (Goebel, et
al., 1984). Hydrogen was subsequently detected during actual
drilling of several other nearby wells (Goebel, et al., 1985) and
numerous hydrogen anomalies were indicated along two soil-gas sample
traverses (Plate 1) run by the Kansas and U.S. Geological Surveys in
1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986; McCauley and Watney, 1984). Although
the origin of the nitrogen has remained somewhat of an enigma, a
search of the relevant literature revealed a minimum of eight possible mechanisms for generating such anomalously high concentrations

of hydrogen in the subsurface (Angino, et al., 1984). The absence

of appreciable CH, or CO, with the gases is indicative of an abiogenic source for the hydrogen. Isotopic ratios and thermodynamic
calculations yield possible equilibration temperatures around 10
degrees C or lower (somewhat below ambient temperature), implying a
deuturium-depleted gas source. The currently most plausible origins
for the Kansas occurrences include ground-water mixing, mantle outgassing, and the the hydration of FeO-rich minerals (for example
olivine) during serpentinization/deserpentinization of mafic or

ultramafic rocks (Coveny, et al., 1987). Of these theories, the

latter may be favored by the position of the occurrence above the
southern end of the Keweenawan-age Midcontinent rift system (central
North American rift system), known to contain partially serpenti
nized mafic rocks (Berendsen,

t al., 1988), and close proximity to
several known kimberlite plugs (Mansker, et al., 1987). Analyses of
gases exsolved from drilling muds during drilling of the CFA Oil #1
Simpson well (Coveney, et al., 1987, fig. 3), CFA Oil #1 Amthauer
well (Plate 1), and wireline well logs of other nearby wells
(Goebel, 1985) have established a stratigraphic range for the hydrogen extending from soil level to the top of the Precambrian basement, further suggesting an intrabasement source.

Although the maximum areal extent of the occurrence is still
rather poorly defined, soil-gas sampling along extensive traverses
(Plate 1) indicates areas in at least 10 Kansas counties are
involved. The highest levels of hydrogen detected along initial
soil-gas traverses were from near the centers of “unusually
straight" stream valleys and an area of Pleistocene(?) age sand
dunes northwest of Abilene (Angino, 1985). Although Phanerozoic
strata in the area of the gas occurrences are essentially flat
lying, the locations and orientations of many streams and rivers in
eastern Kansas are thought to have been influenced by regional joint
trends (Baehr, 1954; McCauley, et al., 1975), near-surface faults
(DuBois, 1978), and reactivated basement fracture zones (Kirk, 1968:
Berendsen, et al., 1978). This suggests that both the near-surface

concentrations and subsurface movements of the hydrogen may be

strongly fracture controlled. If this is true, then knowledge of

ne Ne A A NR OT

the fracture patterns may provide a fundamental key to understanding
the origin, possible trapping, and potential development of this
resource. Although down-hole gas pressures have so far been quite

low (slightly above 1 atm., Coveney, et al., 1987, p. 42), it is

conceivable that such widespread occurrences of anomalous soil-gas
hydrogen could represent the surface expression of a very significant (if economically extractable) future source of energy and raw
materials. Indeed, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986, p. 120) have

predicted that "in the future the extraction and refining of gases

containing hydrogen will become a separate branch of industry."

Study Objectives

In an attempt to clarify further any relationship between
subsurface fractures and hydrogen gas distribution, an integrated
analysis of geologic, geophysical, geochemical, and remotely sensed
data was undertaken for a large area of north-central Kansas. The
primary objectives of this study as originally stated were: 1) to
determine the fracture pattern of the study area with an emphasis on
remote techniques, 2) to relate fracture types and trends to possible tectonic origin(s) and modern crustal stress regime, 3) to
compare hydrogen soil-gas anomalies with fracture locations, and 4)

to develop a working model for subsurface movement of the hydrogen.

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY AREA

Location and Surficial Geology

The study area comprises that portion of north-central Kansas
lying between 96 and 98 degrees west longitude and 38.5 and 40
degrees north latitude, corresponding to the entire Manhattan and
northern one half of the Hutchinson 1:250,000-scale series U.S.
Geological Survey topographic quadrangle sheets. It covers
approximately 28,500 km” (11,000 mi.) of surface area and includes
all or portions of 25 Kansas counties (Figure 1).

Strata cropping out in the study area range from Late Pennsylvanian through Recent in age (Kansas Geological Survey, 1964).
Late Paleozoic and Cretaceous rocks include a sequence of
interlayered marine carbonates and fine terrigenous clastics. The
Middle Permian age Wellington Formation crops out in the central
portion of the study area. It includes a thick salt sequence, the
Hutchinson Salt Member, in much of the Kansas subsurface (Watney and
Paul, 1980), but this salt has been removed from all except the
southwesternmost part of the study area by surface erosion and
subsurface solution (Plate 1). Deposits of Cenozoic age are of
generally minor importance except for thick alluvial fills in larger
stream valleys and a mantle of Pleistocene glaciofluvial sediments
northeast of the Kansan age glacial terminus (Plate 1). Locally in
northern Dickinson and portions of surrounding counties, sandy areas
and small sand dunes of Quaternary age occur on the uplands (Dunlap,

1977; Jantz and Saffry, 1980; Sloanaker, 1950).

Basement Lithologies and Proterozoic Tectonics

The lithologic and structural characteristics of Precambrian
rocks in north-central Kansas are known only from widely scattered
drill hole samples and regional correlations. Holes penetrating
basement rocks within the study area number only about 280, but most
of these occur in a few areas of higher drilling density (Plate 4)
and very few were drilled more than a few meters (10’s of feet) into
Precambrian rocks (Bickford, et al., 1979, 1981; Denison, et al.,
1984). Among the notable exceptions to this general depth rule are
the Hodgen Oil #1 and #1-4 Finn wells in Marshall County, and the
Texaco USA #1-31 Poersch well in Washington County (Plate 1). The
Finn wells both penetrated over 450 m. (1500 ft.) of Precambrian
rocks, and Poersch well is reported to have penetrated approximately
2600 m. (8,450 ft.) of Precambrian gabbros, basalts, and arkosic
clastics (Berendsen et al., 1988). An extensive discussion of the
units encountered in the Poersch well and their possible interpretation is available from Berendsen and others (1988). Unfortunately,
no additional data are currently available for the Finn wells.

The study area lies within the Central Plains tectonic province
(Figure 2), an early Proterozoic accretionary terrane consisting
predominantly of mesozonal granitoid rocks and gneissic metamorphic
rocks of primarily amphibolite grade facies (Bickford, et al., 1986;
Sims and Peterman, 1986). Because rocks of this province are exposed at the surface only in southeastern Wyoming, it has been defined

primarily on the basis of gross geophysical expression, and the

analysis of limited cuttings and core samples available from drill

holes. Most of these samples possess cataclastic textures, suggesting they underwent a period of extensive shearing and deformation
after emplacement. Those samples that have been radiometrically
dated yield early Proterozoic ages ranging from 1,800 to 1,600
million years ago (Ma). Locally within the province a set of anorogenic plutons dated between 1,480 and 1,450 Ma occurs. They yield
nondeformed samples, and thus roughly bracket the timing of the
shearing episode (Denison, et al., 1984, p. (C7). A northwestsoutheast-oriented tectonic grain (Figure 3) that may also reflect
this deformation has been inferred for the terrane in eastern Kansas

and western Missouri (Bickford, et al., 1986; Sims and Peterman,

1986) largely on the basis of geophysical and structural trends.
Farther east in central Missouri, a northwest-southeast-trending
gravity low (the Missouri gravity low) and corresponding set of
structural features (Missouri tectonic zone) has been mapped within
the province that has been variously interpreted as a rifted arm of

a possible "rrr-type" type triple junction (Guinness, et al., 1982;

Kisvarsanyi, 1984), major transcurrent fault (Arvidson, t al

1982), or collisional suture (Bowring, et al., 1988) that apparently
predated a middle Proterozoic (1,485 to 1,350 Ma) epizonal graniterhyolite terrane underlying much of southern Missouri, southern
Kansas, and Oklahoma. Detailed analysis of regional aeromagnetic
data in south-central Kansas by Gay (1986, 1988) suggests that an
more complex history of Proterozoic tectonism than previously

supposed may be recorded in the basement there.

gravity maps (eg. Hildenbrand, et al., 1982) and magnetic maps (eg.
Zietz, 1982) is the Midcontinent geophysical anomaly (MGA). The MGA
corresponds to the middle Proterozoic (Keweenawan) age "central
North America rift system" (CNARS) of Ocola and Meyer (1973), also
known as the "Midcontinent rift system". The CNARS extends from
Lake Superior southwest to at least the southern boarder of Kansas
(Figure 2) and may continue into Oklahoma (Yarger, 1983). Basalts
cropping out in the Lake Superior region and sampled in boreholes
into the CNARS farther south yield middle Proterozoic radiometric
ages ranging from 1,250 to 950 Ma (Berendsen, et al., 1988).

The CNARS has generally been interpreted as an "aborted rift,"
but debate continues about the precise plate-tectonic event that
produced this apparent failure (Gordon and Hempton, 1983). The
CNARS cuts obliquely across the previously established Archean and
Proterozoic accretionary margins (Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985) and
this may have been a factor in its "failure." Several apparent
offsets occur along the trend of the CNARS and these have generally
been interpreted as transform faults (Carlson and Treves, 1988;
Chase and Gilmer, 1973), but Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 373)
suggested "the rift system was deflected along preexisting structures" at these locations. This latter interpretation agrees with
Ramberg and Smithson’s (1975) conclusion that rift-related faulting
generally follows preexisting fractures locally and the major trends
of rift zones reflect deep-seated crustal inhomogeneities. One such
offset occurs just north of the study area in southeastern Nebraska

and may correspond with the northwest extension of the older(?)

10
Missouri gravity low mentioned above (Arvidson, et al., 1982).
The study area lies astride the northern Kansas portion of the
CNARS (Figure 2). Early interpretations of the CNARS structure in

Kansas (Coons, 1966; Coons, et al., 1967; Scott, 1969) proposed a

central basalt-cored horst block and two flanking clastic basins.
Deep seismic reflection profiling over the CNARS in 1981 by the
Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) program in
northeastern Kansas (Plate 1) has confirmed its rift nature (Brown,
et al., 1983; Gries, 1984; Serpa, et al., 1984), but according to
their interpretation, the CNARS is now thought to consist of an
asymmetric fault-bounded basin roughly 80 km (50 mi.) wide and upto
8 km (5 mi.) deep. The basin is apparently segmented into several
sub-basins by major east-dipping normal faults and these are now
known to be filled with an interlayered sequence of coeval basalt
(900 to 1100 Ma) and arkosic clastics deposited during the time of
rifting (Berendsen, et al., 1988; Dickas and Mundrey, 1988). This
sequence of clastics, loosely termed the Rice Formation by Scott
(1966), had received considerable attention recently as a possible
commercial hydrocarbon source (Dickas, 1984; Fritz, 1985; Gustavson,
1983; Herman, et al., 1985; Lee and Kerr, 1983, 1984; McCaslin,
1984; Newell, et al., 1988a, p. 3), although initial testing has

been disappointing (Berendsen, et al., 1988). The presence of a

large mafic intrusive body at mid-crustal levels underlying the
central portion of the rift basin is indicated by gravity modelling

(Somanas, 1984) and a low velocity body in the upper mantle is

suggested by teleseismic residuals data (Hahn, 1980; Miller, 1983).

een et aren en a rn hE

Near the Lake Superior area, the rift zone is characterized by
two prominent sets of faults: a set of high-angle flanking faults
striking parallel to the trend of the rift, and a second set of
shorter but more numerous transverse faults striking generally
perpendicular to the trend of the rift and cutting the older set
(see Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985, Fig. 4, p. 370). Although they
were probably originally high-angle normal faults generated during
Keweenawan time by the tensional forces responsible for the rifting
event, some of the flanking faults now possess considerable reverse
stratigraphic throw and must therefore represent subsequent compression of the rift zone. For example, there is an indication on deep
seismic reflection data in southwestern Iowa that substantial Precambrian reverse throw may be present along certain rift-related
faults there (Herman, et al., 1985, p. 25). Reprocessing and interpretation of the Kansas COCORP data has also suggested possible

thrust displacements (Berendsen, et

1., 1988, p. 12) along features

previously supposed to be listric normal faults (Serpa, et al.,

1984). Few of the transverse faults in the outcrop area show this
reverse sense of movement. Because similar sets of "gridded" (axisperpendicular and axis-parallel) faults characterize many rifts
worldwide (Ramberg and Smithson, 1975), it seems reasonable to
assume such a set also typifies the CNARS in the subsurface to the
south and west of the Lake Superior area. In fact, Berendsen and
others (1988, Fig. 18) portray such a gridded fault pattern for a

portion of the CNARS in northernmost Kansas, which includes roughly

the northeastern third of the study area (Figure 4).

Contrary to the statement by Van Schmus and Hinze (1985, p. 376)
that the CNARS shows little evidence of post-Keweenawan reactivation,
the Midcontinent rift in Kansas appears to correspond to an area of
periodic epierogenic deformation and Paleozoic faulting, relatively
abundant modern seismicity and active basement faults, and numerous
kimberlite intrusives (see below). These features, in addition to a
Cambrian age (545 Ma) carbonatite intrusion just north of the study

t al., 1975a, 1975b; Carlson, 1988)

area in Nebraska (Brookins,
attest to the deeply fractured and periodically reactivated nature
of the Midcontinent crust along the CNARS (Nishimori and Powell,

1980, p. 30-39; Sykes, 1978).

Phanerozoic History

In comparison with the Proterozoic, the Phanerozoic depositional history and structure of the study area is relatively well
known. Lower and middle Paleozoic strata preserved in the subsurface of the study area consist predominantly of marine carbonates
and siliciclastics deposited near the margin of the relatively
stable North Kansas basin (Figure 5). During this time period,
plate tectonic interactions at the continental margins produced
generally minor, epeirogenic deformation over portions of the CNARS
in Kansas (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4) and other basementinvolved structures throughout much of the Midcontinent. At least
three such orogenic episodes are recorded in the form of regional

unconformities and thickness trends within the lower and middle

Paleozoic strata of the study area (Willoughby and Berendsen, 1978a,

1978b), and locally as anomalous lithologies (Berendsen and Doveton,
1988). Detailed discussions of the gross regional Paleozoic stratigraphic and structural relations preserved in the study area are
available elsewhere (Lee, 1943, 1956).

Near the close of Mississippian time the collision of the
southern margin of the present North American plate with the South
African plate produced north-northwest-directed principal horizontal
stress, culminating in the Early Pennsylvanian Ouchita orogeny.
Compressive stress was propagated cratonward from the Ouachita orogenic front of northern Arkansas and southern Oklahoma and produced
major uplift along the Humboldt fault zone, Abilene anticline, and
similar structures throughout much of the Midcontinent (Carlson,
1988; Howe, 1988). This Late Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and (7)
Early Permian tectonic episode resulted in the formation of the
Nemaha anticline which subdivided the former North Kansas Basin into
the present day Salina and Forest City basins (Figure 6). This
uplift may have been a result of convergent left-lateral strike-slip
(wrench) faulting along preexisting northeast-trending basement
faults (Blair and Berendsen, 1985, 1988; Davis, 1984; Fenster and
Trapp, 1982; Heyl, 1977; Phipps, 1983). Detailed subsurface studies
indicate the Nemaha anticline/Humboldt fault zone consists of a
complex series of scissor faults, sigmoid anticlines, horst and
graben features, pull-apart basins (Berendsen and Blair, 1986a;
Eccles, 1981; Newell, 1987; Steeples, 1982), en-echelon fault zones
(Fath, 1920, 1921; Foley, 1926), reverse-slip faults (Smith and

Anders, 1951; Steeples and Yarger, 1983), and anastomosing fault

zones (Burchett and Arrigo, 1978), all of which are features
consistent with wrench fault deformation (eg. Harding, 1973; Maxwell
and Wise, 1958; Moody, 1973; Moody and Hill, 1956, 1964; Prucha,

1964; Sylvester, 1982; Wilcox, et al., 1973). Thus, the Humboldt

fault zone within the study area almost certainly represents a riftmarginal fault complex of the CNARS in Kansas that was reactivated
periodically throughout the Paleozoic (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, p.

4; Serpa, et al., 1984; Somanas, 1984; Yarger, 1983, p. 29).

Minor continued uplift along the Nemaha structural trend, and
to a lesser extent the associated Abilene anticline (Figure 7),
through Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian times produced significant bathymetric irregularities which had a pronounced local control
on marginal marine depositional environments and biota (Fisher,
1980; Lorenzen, 1973; Sporleder, 1987; Stewart, 1963, p. 12) as well
as important regional and local effects on overall sequence thicknesses and lithologies (Eccles, 1981; Merriam, 1963, p. 98-101, 107112, 118-119). Similar apparent Pennsylvanian and Permian lithotectonic relationships have been suggested elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Watney and Wilson, 1983), although they may have resulted
in part from passive differential compaction over existing structures (Gentile, 1968, 1979, 1984, p. 36; Steeples and Yarger, 1983).

Mesozoic and Tertiary strata are not present over the uplift
within the study area, having either never been deposited, or else,
deposited and subsequently removed. However, studies of overlapping
relations to the north in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa indicate

the Nemaha anticline was again uplifted during the Cretaceous to

Figure /. Map showing location of Abilene anticline (after Shenkel, 1959, Fig.
early Tertiary Laramide orogeny (Bunker, 1981; Bunker, et al., 1981;
Carlson, 1988). The presence of numerous Cretaceous-age kimberlite
intrusives in close proximity to the uplift (Plate 1) has also been
cited as evidence for renewed tectonic activity during Laramide time
by Chelikowsky (1972), Fenster and Trapp (1982), and Taylor (1950).
The northwest-southeast orientations of kimberlite outcrops and
their associated magnetic anomalies have been cited as evidence for
emplacement along similarly oriented fractures (Brookins, 1970a,
1970b; Mansker, et al., 1987). Chelikowsky argued on the basis of
these orientations, regional joint trends, and major fault geometries for right-lateral reactivation of the Abilene anticline and
Humboldt fault system in response to east-west directed Laramide
principal horizontal stresses, although the evidence for such an
interpretation is not clearcut (Steeples, 1982, p. 58-59). It does
seem possible that considerable stress could have been transmitted
as far cratonward as north-central Kansas on the basis of Bird's
(1984, Fig. 10) model for Laramide foreland deformation and associated Great Plains crustal thickening. The Chadron-Cambridge arch, a
structurally related uplift of western Nebraska and northern Kansas
(Figure 6), was apparently rejuvenated as recently as the Pliocene
and Pleistocene (Stanley and Wayne, 1972).

Seismic activity has persisted along the CNARS to the present
time as evidenced by historic earthquake epicenter data (Burchett,

et al., 1983; DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Eccles, 1981) and microquake

records (Steeples, et al., 1987). The modern principal horizontal

stress (PHS) is oriented approximately east-northeast/west-southwest

20

throughout much of the Midcontinent according to regional well-bore
breakout data, earthquake fault-plane solutions, and various

measures of in-situ stress (Dart, 1987; Zoback and Zoback, 1980).

Faults and Joints

At present, northern Kansas lies within the Prairie Plains
monocline structural province of the central stable region of the
North American craton (Jewett, 1951). Regional dips of a few meters
per kilometer (about 14 feet per mile) or less (<l degree) to the
west are common, although smaller structures can have important
local effects. Only a few surface faults have been recognized
within the Paleozoic rocks of the study area and all are relatively
small in length and vertical displacement (Bruton, 1958; Eccles,
1981; Hooker, 1956; Underwood and Polson, 1987, 1988). Even fewer
surface faults have been mapped previously within Cretaceous strata
of the study area (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962). The Humboldt fault
zone may reach the surface in Nemaha and northeastern Pottawatomie
counties (Du Bois, 1978; Ratcliff, 1957), but this has been disputed
(Seyrafian, 1977). Published studies of subsurface structure in the
vicinity of study area oil and gas fields suggest basement-involved
faulting has played an important role in localizing many of these
accumulations (Curtis, 1960; Smith and Anders, 1951). Berendsen and
others (1988, p. 4) state that Paleozoic reactivation of study area
basement faults resulted in the formation of many Kansas structures.
This is in accordance with the findings of Merriam (1963, p. 227)

that a close correlation exists between the orientations of 99

21

subsurface anticlines (Figure 8A) and 50 suspected subsurface faults
(Figure 8B) in central and northwestern Kansas. Berendsen and Blair
(1986a) utilized subsurface elevations from 3,794 wells to construct
a series of contour maps for six important Paleozoic horizons in
central Kansas, including approximately the southern fourth of the
study area. They mapped a large number of previously named structural features, as well as many unrecognized structures, including
numerous possible subsurface faults. Their maps also show a close
correlation exists between the locations and orientations of faults
and anticlines in central Kansas.

Although joints are the most common fractures observed in the
outcrops of Kansas, they have received only limited study. Prominent regional joint sets striking N.2-4°E. and N.10-14°W. in the
Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation of Hamilton County were remarked
upon by Bass (1926, p. 80). Although not in Kansas, Melton’s (1929)
early work in Oklahoma deserves mention here. He measured approximately 4,000 joint trends in Pennsylvanian and Lower Permian rocks
at 106 localities in central and southeastern Oklahoma. He determined a dominant set strikes N.37°W., correlating closely with the
strike of faults in the eastern Oklahoma "en echelon" fault belt
(Fath, 1920, 1921, p. 150-155), and a less prominent set strikes
about N.65°E. Neff (1949) compiled a large number of joint orientations for Lower Permian limestones cropping out in each township of
Riley County and determined the existence of a primary set oriented
about N.72°E. and a subsidiary, somewhat variable, set striking

about N.25°W. He postulated that the primary set developed in

response to late Paleozoic northwest-southeast directed tensile
stress, and the secondary set developed differentially in response
to irregularities of local basement structure (i.e. Nemaha and
Abilene anticlines). Nelson (1952) mapped an unstated number of
joint trends in the Permian limestones of Marshall County and determined (p. 31) a major set strikes at N.76°E. and a minor set strikes
at N.15°W. He combined these findings with Neff's (1949) data from
adjacent Riley County in an attempt to determine any influences of
Precambrian basement structures on the surface fracture pattern of
the area. He concluded (p. 54-59) that the joint pattern expressed
at the present land surface reflects an "upward transmission and
progressive rotation" of a much older basement joint pattern.

Wagner (1961) used low-altitude aerial photos to map joint
traces in Upper Pennsylvanian limestones and sandstones over much of
Wilson County and recorded two general groups of N.55°E. and N.35°W.
Stewart (1962) used a similar method to map 10,065 fracture (joint)
traces in northern Cleveland County, central Oklahoma (due south of
Sumner County, Kansas). He demonstrated a prominent set oriented at
about N.49°E. and a secondary mode at about N.24°W. Later Stewart
(1967) recorded 881 joint orientations on outcrops of four Upper
Pennsylvanian limestones of Atchison, Jefferson, Douglas, and Osage
counties. He documented a dominant set of "shear" joints trending
N.60°E., a less common set of tension joints trending N.35°W., and a
third set of short, tight joints trending about N.3°E. Ward (1968)
measured the orientations of 5,777 joints in Upper Pennsylvanian and

Lower Permian limestone outcrops of Butler, Cowley, Greenwood,

24
Chase, and Marion counties. He found two prominent sets with orientations that also average N.60°E. and N.35°W. He stated (p. 21-22)
that no correlation was apparent between the orientations of joints
and underlying faults, the joints were post-Early Permian and preEarly Cretaceous in age, and they may have formed as a result of
northwest-southeast directed horizontal compressive stress generated
during the uplift of the Ouchita Mountains. Jefferis (1969) measured approximately 320 joint orientations in two Upper Pennsylvanian
limestones of southern Douglas County. He found (p. 20, Fig. 9) two
sets of well developed joints trending about N.63°E. and N.41°W, and
a third set of short and tight joints trending about N.2°W. Hagen
(1972, 1985) mapped the surface traces of 2615 joints in Lower
Permian limestones of Osage and Kay counties in north-central Oklahoma (just south of Cowley County, Kansas) as they might relate to
waterflooding success. He found a "remarkably uniform" major set at
N.70°E. and a much less common mean at N.35°W. DuBois (1978) measured the orientations of an unstated number of joints in Lower
Permian limestones of northestern Nemaha County. She found two
pronounced sets oriented at about N.85°E. and N.35W. Macfarlane
(1979) measured about 180 joints in Lower Permian limestones of
northeastern Morris County. He found (his Plate C) a prominent set
at N.45°E. and a less common set at N.52°W. Hoppie (1980) measured
311 joints on 98 outcrops of the Lower Cretaceous Kiowa Shale and
Lower(?) Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone, and 190 joints from 48 exposures of the Upper Cretaceous Greenhorn Limestone in Ottawa, Cloud,

and Mitchell counties. He found (p. 52, Fig. 12) one well-developed

25

set trending N.83°W. in the Greenhorn Limestone, but no distinct
modes were apparent in data for the older clastic units. He concluded that the joints of the Cretaceous rocks of north-central Kansas
were not formed in the same tectonic province as those in the upper
Paleozoic strata of eastern Kansas. Eccles (1981) documented a few
joint trends in Lower Permian Limestones of western Wabaunsee and
eastern Riley counties. He determined (p. 40) means of N.76°E. and
N.12°W. for joints in Wabaunsee County, and (p. 45) means of N.65°E.
and N.21°W. for Riley County sets.

The most recent studies of Kansas joint orientations and their
possible origins are those of Drees (1974) and Neuhauser (1983,
1986). They measured the orientations of 250 joints in the Upper
Cretaceous Fort Hays Limestone Member of Ellis County and determined
a dominant set strikes N.70°W. and a less prominant set strikes
N.25°E. Neuhauser attributed the formation of these two sets to a
conjugate shear couple developed in response to nearly east-west
directed compressive stress of probable early Tertiary (late-Laramide orogeny) age.

A summary of relevant statistics for each of the foregoing
studies is presented in map form on Figure 9. Each symbol represents a single study, and the orientation and length of each ray
corresponds to the orientation and relative abundance of each joint
set measured in a given study. Note the relative consistancy of the
two sets expressed in Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks, and their
distinct discordance with sets in the Cretaceous strata to the west.

Drainage Pattern

The drainage pattern of Kansas and its origin represents an
interesting aspect of Kansas geology that has received rather sporadic attention over the years, but little detailed study. At first
glance, the drainage network over much of Kansas appears to demonstrate a "textbook example" of the basic dendritic pattern expected
for areas of flat-lying rocks of fairly uniform lithology (Howard,
1967). However, on closer inspection (Plate 2) it becomes apparent
that certain orientations are more prevalent than others, producing
a distinctly subdendritic to rectangular drainage pattern. This
deviation from purely dentritic suggests some form of structural
control influenced drainage development in Kansas (Morisawa, 1985,
p. 145).

Early works on the relationships between drainage and structure
in Kansas are qualitative to semiquantitative at best. Bass (1928,
1929, p. 17-23) remarked on the pronounced asymmetry of many Kansas
drainage basins and suggested differential weathering effects due to
topographic aspect, rather than structural or tectonic influences,
were the cause. During his study of regional joint systems, Nelson
(1952) noted the distinctly rectangular nature of the drainage
pattern in Riley and Marshall counties. He stated (p. 47) "probably
more than 75 percent of the streams in Riley County show some joint

control." Melton (1959) determined the relative frequencies of

28
drainage orientations in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma and
found that the most abundant stream trends were strongly correlated
with the solar insolation angle (i.e. oriented preferentially northsouth) and secondarily with regional joint patterns. This solar
influence on drainage was most pronounced in lower order basins,
whereas apparent joint effects were strongest on higher order
streams. This conclusion differs somewhat from the findings of
Baehr (1954) who studied drainage and rock structure in three small
drainage basins in Geary and Riley counties, Kansas. Baehr stated
(p. 57) that bedding and joints acted as the primary controls on
headward migration of gullies and minor tributaries cutting the
thick Permian limestones of his study area. He did not attribute
any components to nongeologic (i.e. solar) effects.

Merriam (1955, p. 82) commented briefly on the obvious angularity of drainage patterns in western Kansas and later (Merriam, 1963,
p. 254) suggested a bedrock fracture control. Kirk (1968) noted a
rectilinear pattern existed for much of the drainage pattern of
eastern Kansas. He correlated the prominent stream trends with
surface fractures, basement faults, earthquake epicenter distribution, geophysical anomaly trends, and the location of surface igneous intrusions, but offered no quantitative data in support. Ward
(1968) remarked (p. 15) on the apparent influence of regional joint
sets on both the overall drainage pattern, and the specific locations of many smaller drainageways. Chelikowsky (1972, p. 7) also
mentioned an "angular pattern" to the drainage network of Riley

County which he attributed to the regional joint pattern, but did

29

not offer any data to support this assertion. Hagen (1972, 1985),
during his study of joints in north-central Oklahoma, noticed that
they had apparently exercised a strong control on drainage orientations. He ascribed a less prominent north-south drainage maximum
(Melton’s “solar insolation effect"?) to bedding control and all
minor orientations to "Precambrian shears." McNaughton (1974;

McCauley, et al., 1975) utilized an optical Fourier transform of

Landsat satellite imagery to define dominant stream trends for
several portions of north-central Kansas. They argued that tectonic
influences had produced zones of weakness in the surface strata
along which streams tended to preferentially downcut. Seyrafian
(1977, p. 35-42) examined some straight stream segments during his
study of the Humboldt fault zone in northeastern Pottawatomie County, and concluded that strike-slip faulting might account for their
locations and orientations, although obvious stratigraphic evidence
for faulting was lacking. Berendsen and others (1978) utilized the
linear trends of major eastern Kansas rivers to define structural
lineaments in the Precambrian basement, although they did not state
exactly why this relationship should be true.

More recently, Hoppie (1980) evaluated statistically the possible geologic influences on the morphology, including orientation, of
the Solomon River in north-central Kansas. He concluded that the
orientation of a portion of the river flowing over the Cretaceous
Greenhorn Limestone may have been determined by a well-developed
joint set in this unit, but elsewhere the evidence was inconclusive.

Merriam and Sorensen (1982, Fig. 2) mapped a set of prominent topo
30
inn HN Ne eS LL LATS NAY Rs RU _

graphic lineaments in Elk, Greenwood, and Chautauqua counties,
Kansas, and suggested (p. 3) that they reflect regional basement
fault-block structures.

Most recently, the author (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987) studied the
orientations of 4426 straight drainage segments at three scales
within a large portion of north-central Kansas (including the entire
present study area) in an attempt to clarify this apparent relationship between structure and drainage. A distinct N.0-10°E. drainage
orientation mode (Melton’s (1959) "solar insolation angle" mode?)
occurs in all areas and at all scales examined. However, a satisfactory mechanism (other than "solar insolation") for producing this
trend is still lacking. Among geologic controls, regional joint
trends were most strongly correlated with drainage in small order
drainage basins and regional fold axes correlated best with river
and major stream orientations. Because very few surface faults have
been mapped in this area (see above), correlation between surface
fault trends and drainage orientations was difficult to assess.
However, the finding of Merriam (1963, p. 227) that the orientations
of regional folds in Kansas are strongly correlated with (controlled
by?) regional subsurface fault trends implies that the angular
orientations of many study area rivers and streams were perhaps
determined by subsurface faults, rather than regional joint sets as
previously supposed. This also agrees with a statement of Berendsen
and Blair (1984; 1986a, p. 11) that many suspected central Kansas
subsurface faults have corresponding drainage and topographic

features.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Fracture Detection

A large number of techniques for detecting the locations and
orientations of subsurface fractures exist. These range from geologic methods, such as direct observation of joints and faults in the
field, to a diverse number of geochemical, geophysical, and remote
sensing methods. The suitability of a given technique to a particular application depends on factors such as geologic setting, allowable costs, time considerations, necessary precision in locating
individual fractures, and availablity of supporting information
(Goldstein, 1985).

Among geologic methods, surface studies of fault and joint
orientations have received considerable attention in the past.
Regional joint trends are easily determined from simple outcrop
measurements. Unfortunately, surface joint trends may not reflect
major fracture patterns at depth, (Ludvigson and McAdams, 1980, p.
13). In addition, such studies often contain severe investigatorinduced biases due to improper selection and sampling of outcrops,
and only rarely include important information such as joint spacing
and character (La Pointe and Hudson, 1985). Field mapping may be
useful in defining the locations of major faults, but minor faults
or those with little stratigraphic displacement are easily missed,
particularly in areas with thick vegetative cover or sparse bedrock
exposures. Likewise, in areas where subsurface control is good,

structure mapping can often accurately resolve many fault locations.

32

tt heer Ne eee sa ce ett arma it

Unfortunately, in areas of widely spaced drill hole data, such as
the Salina Basin area of northern Kansas, even major faults may be
impossible to recognize.

Down-hole studies, such as borehole televiewing and "fracturefinder" type electric logging, can also provide absolute measurements on the locations and orientations of individual fractures, but
must be performed on uncased holes soon after drilling. Similarly,
thin-section studies require the acquisition of oriented cores
during drilling. All down-hole methods suffer from very limited
areal resolution.

Among surface geophysical approaches to fracture detection,
potential-field methods such as gravity and magnetic mapping have
received only limited use, primarily because they tend to reveal
only intrabasement discontinuities and lack the ability to resolve
precisely the locations of individual fractures (Lewis and Haeni,
1987). Electromagnetic methods such as earth resistivity and Very
Low Frequency (VLF) radiowave surveys have been used to detect
subsurface fractures with varying success (Anderson, 1981; Crumpton
and Badgley, 1959; Steele, 1982), but are time-consuming and of
limited applicablity. In regions with fairly high levels of seismicity, for example southern California and Missouri's New Madrid
area, plotting accurately-located earthquake epicenters may produce
alignments that can be related to fracture locations with some
certainty. One of the more widely used methods for mapping natural
fracture systems is high-resolution reflection seismic data (Till
man, 1983, p. 165). Unfortunately, seismic studies suffer from

33
fairly high acquisition and processing costs and the inability to
resolve fractures along which little or no vertical movement has

occured (Aguilera, 1980).

Lineament Analysis

One of the most widely used and almost universally accepted
approaches to mapping fracture locations and orientations is lineament analysis of topographic maps, potential-field geophysical data,
and remotely sensed imagery. In spite of this widespread acceptance
and use, the terminology of lineament analysis is little agreed upon
and has undergone many changes since the time Hobbs (1904, 1911)
first described linear topographic alignments in the landscape of
the northeastern United States. In this paper I will follow the
general definition of a lineament as set forth by Caran and others
(1981) as "a figure that is perceived in an image or other factual
representation of a solid planetary body that is linear and continuous, has definable end points and lateral boundaries, has a relatively high length to width ratio, a descernable azimuth, and is
shown or presumed to correlate with planetary elements whose origin
is geologically controlled." Under this definition, any linear
features perceived on topographic maps, visible or infrared spectral
data (eg. aerialphotos or Landsat satellite images) or any linear
discontinuities on potential-field geophysical data can be termed
lineaments. To reduce confusion somewhat, linear topographic features (including linear stream segments) could be termed “geomorphic

lineaments", linear spectral features could be termed "photolinea
34

ments", and those apparent on geophysical data could be termed
"geophysical lineaments", or more specifically, "gravity lineaments"
and "magnetic lineaments". This is the specific usage followed
herein.

Since the time of Hobbs (1904, 1911) early papers on the subject, geomorphic lineaments and various types of photolineaments
have probably received the most attention as possible indicators of
subsurface fractures (eg. Caran, et al., 1981; Gilluly, 1977; Haman,
1961, 1964). Readily apparent on virtually any topographic map,
aerial photo, or space image of almost any earth terrain (Gay, 1973,
appendix 2), both types lineaments have generally been considered
the surface traces of subsurface fractures of various types. Unfortunately, in many early lineament studies the precise geologic
origin of these lineaments was not addressed or was stated as "unclear". Lineaments were simply mapped and a structural connotation
was assumed with little substantiating data (Anderson, 1981, p. 1).
The apparently limited value of these early investigations (Gilluly,
1977) probably resulted from inadequate study documentation, inconsistent mapping methods, and indiscriminate use of terms such as
"lineation," "lineament," "“photolinear," “linear feature," "“alignment," and "fracture trace," (Caran, et al., 1981; O’Leary and
Friedman, 1978; O'Leary, et al., 1976a, 1976b). Some researchers
could demonstrate good agreement between the trends of shorter
lineaments and the orientations of major (regional) joint sets (eg.

Boyer and McQueen, 1964; Brown, 1961; Dean, et al

— <a ?

1985; Loar,

1985), which strongly suggested a genetic relationship. In other

35

studies a particular linear feature was shown to correspond to a
zone of more intense jointing in the underlying strata (Lattman and
Matzke, 1961) and less often to mappable surface faults (Brown,
1961; Elifrits, 1982; Jefferis, 1969). The largest of linear
features were generally correlated with suspected basement faults
(eg. Dean, et al., 1984; Hughes, 1983; Lattman, 1958; Maughan and
Perry, 1983) and sub-continental sized fracture zones (Wise, 1969).
Salisbury and Merriam (1984) showed that the major Landsat
photolineament orientations present in an area of southeastern Canada and New York with outcropping Precambrian crystalline basement
rocks were also present in adjacent areas where the basement was
overlain by thick lower Paleozoic strata. They suggested that the
tectonic forces responsible for creating these lineaments in both
areas either: 1) post-date the sediments altogether, or 2) that some
other mechanism caused existing pre-Paleozoic lineaments to promulgate upward from the basement subsequent to deposition of the sediments. They favored the latter interpretation. Elsewhere, studies
in terrains covered by Pleistocene glacial deposits and other unconsolidated sediments have indicated bedrock fractures are also represented by corresponding fractures in the overlying deposits and as
photolineaments on images of these areas (DuBois, 1978; Mollard,
1958; Rumsey, 1971; Thumult, 1984). Among the mechanisms that have
been suggested for producing such a upward propagation and surface
expression of deeper fractures are earth tides, earthquakes and
microquakes, plate tectonic compressional and tensional stresses,

earth rotational stresses, and recurrent glacial loading and unload
36
ing (Rumsey, 1971, p. 30-32), and ground-water related processes
(Berger and Aghassy, 1984). Inasmuch as the northeastern portion of
the study area was glaciated during the Pleistocene (Plate 1) and
locations of surface springs and seeps over much of the study area
are probably controlled by near-surface bedrock joints (Donald Whittemore, verbal comm., June 1988), these latter two factors may be
particularly relevant to the present investigation.

Regardless of their precise geologic origin, photolineaments
are now routinely used by geologists for both reconnaissance- level
and detailed structural analysis throughout the world. This is
evidenced by both the abundant literature on geologic applications
of remotely sensed data and an ongoing series of international
conferences dedicated to the study of lineaments in general, of
which seven have been held since 1974 (eg. Gabrielson, et al.,
1983). Regional and local analyses of photolineaments are now
frequently used as an aid in assessing the tectonic structure and
petroleum potential of frontier basins (eg. Halbouty, 1976, 1980;
Moore and Anderson, 1985), targetting areas for mineral exploration
(eg. Halbouty, 1976), locating zones of enhanced ground water or
natural gas yields (Cooley, 1984; Jammallo, 1983; Rauch, 1984;
Rodgers and Anderson, 1984), defining fractured zones important to
geothermal energy development (Goldstein, 1985), and predicting
fracture trends that might affect induced fracturing of petroleum
reservoirs and enhanced recovery operations (Alplay, 1969; Hagen,

1985; Shumaker, et al., 1976).

Within Kansas and nearby areas, photolineaments have been

37

mapped on aerialphoto mosaics by Stelljes (1964), on radar imagery
by Jefferis (1969), and on Landsat satellite imagery by Anderson
(1981), Callen (1983, 1985), Cooley (1984, 1986), Dwivedi (1983),
McCauley (1988), McCauley and others (1978), Patton and Manwaring
(1984), Peterson (1979), Podwysocki (1974), Proctor and others
(1979), and Toweh (1978), among others. The tectonic implications
of some of these studies are discussed in the Results section below.

Gravity and magnetic lineaments have also generally been considered to reflect possible basement faults, although the literature
on their analysis is not as numerous as for lineaments on topographic maps and remotely sensed images (Lewis and Haeni, 1987). Many
of the basic principles of gravity and magnetic lineament interpretation are given by Dean and others (1984), Gay (1972), Jammallo
(1983), Ossinger (1983), Peterson (1985a, 1985b), and Rasmussen
(1983), to mention a few. Yarger (1983) mapped aeromagnetic lineaments in Kansas (Figure 10) and considered most of these features
(p. 29) to correspond to unmapped intrabasement faults and other
lithologic discontinuities. Lam (1987) mapped a large number of
gravity lineaments in Kansas (Figure 11) and reached similar conclusions (p. 144) regarding their origin. lLength-weighted azimuthal
histograms ("rose diagrams") of Lam’s eastern Kansas gravity lineaments and Yarger’s eastern Kansas aeromagnetic lineaments are presented here (Figures 12A and 12B respectively). On figures 10 and
11 note a very prominant set of north-northeast-oriented lineaments
in central Kansas (corresponding with the trace of the Midcontinent

rift through Kansas) that produces a distinct mode centered on about

N.30°E. on each respective rose diagram (Figure 12). Note also a
secondary mode centered on about N.50°W. on each rose diagram that
results from a distinct set of northwest-oriented geophysical lineaments in eastern Kansas. Finally, note a third, much less distinct,
east-west mode occurs in the gravity data and possibly in the aeromagnetic data. In a study of detailed gravity and aeromagnetic data
in southeastern Kansas and adjacent Missouri, Adkins-Heljeson and
others (1988) mapped prominent sets of NW-SE and NE-SW-oriented
lineaments and likewise interpreted them to reflect the structural
grain of the basement there.

Increasingly, multi-source integrated studies have been used to
detect and map natural fracture systems. Such studies often rely on
information sources as diverse as lineament analyses of gravity,
magnetic and remotely sensed data; seismic reflection profiles;
drainage-pattern analysis; oil-field distribution, engineering, and
recovery parameters; geochemical anomalies; earthquake epicenter and
focal plane data; surface and subsurface geologic mapping; and
various borehole studies, such as in-situ stress measurements (see
for example Thumult, 1984; Vixo and Bryan, 1984). Berendsen and
others (1978) conducted such an integrated study for eastern Kansas,
including the present study area, but portrayed their results on
small scale maps, severely limiting their utility for subsequent
detailed analysis at a local level. The present investigation is an
attempt at a similar integrated study using much of the same data,
but with the resultant maps presented at a possibly more useful

final scale.

Drainage Pattern Analysis

Much of the literature on drainage analysis concerns determination of the nature of structural controls on general drainage development, rather than precise locations or orientations of individual
structures that may have influenced particular stream locations or
trends. Most quantitative drainage pattern studies involve measurement of drainage segment orientation frequencies to determine the
degree of uniformity. In areas of flat-lying homogenous strata,
drainage networks tend to display a nearly uniform distribution of
drainage-segment orientations (Morisawa, 1963). Strong deviations
from such uniformity can be interpreted to reflect the influences of
lithology and structural fabric on drainage development (Flarity,
1978; Morisawa, 1985, p. 164; Schick, 1965). In areas of nonuniform
stream orientations where close agreement exists between drainage
orientation modes and dominant structural trends, such as joint,
fault and fold orientations, it is probable that a high degree of
structural control is reflected by the drainage pattern (Cox and
Harrison, 1979; Judson and Andrews, 1955). This relationship is
usually strongest with higher order drainage segments (Delano, 1977;
Flarity, 1978; Jarvis, 1977). It follows then, that in such areas,
there is a good likelihood that a given straight segment of a particular river or stream oriented close to a structural orientation
mode may indicate the actual surface location of such a feature.
Stated another way, an analysis of straight drainage segments (geomorphic lineaments) in an area of nonuniform drainage orientations

could help reveal the surface traces of individual structural fea
43
tures, such as faults, joints and possibly folds, particularly where
they correspond closely to any independent measures of potential

fracture locations.

Soil Gases and Gas Migration

Surprisingly little has been written regarding the occurrence
and interpretation of nonhydrocarbon gases in soils and the subsurface. Helium is perhaps the most commonly reported nonhydrocarbon
gas targetted by soil geochemical surveys. Regional helium soil gas
surveys are generally conducted in an effort to locate oil and gas
fields, uranium and thorium deposits, or geothermal energy fields
(eg. Cunningham, 1987; Cunningham, et al., 1987; Gole and Butt,
1985; Jones and Drozd, 1983; Pogorski and Quirt, 1980). Hydrogen
determinations are occasionally incorporated in soil gas surveys
related to petroleum exploration (eg. Nechayeva, 1968; Rodgers and
Anderson, 1984), but opinions differ on anomaly interpretation.
Sato and others (1984, p. 377) state that site characteristics, such
as local geomorphology and geology, that must be considered in
interpreting anomaly magnitudes. The potential for contamination
from near-surface biogenic sources of hydrogen has also been suggested as a limitation on its utility as an exploration technique (Gole
and Butt, 1985), but the soil-gas work and global hydrogen-budget
models of Conrad and Seiler (1985) indicate that most soils, in
fact, form a sink (not source) for hydrogen, and account for the
annual destruction of up to 95% of the tropospheric hydrogen. Some

hydrogen soil gas anomalies have been shown to correspond with the

4d
surface traces of active faults (Jones and Drozd, 1983, p. 942;

Wakita, et al., 1980; Ware, et

al., 1984) and nondiurnal temporal
fluctuations in soil gas hydrogen concentrations in proximity to
such features have received considerable attention recently as
possible earthquake event predictors (see for example MgGee, et al

—— oa" 3

1983; Satake, et al., 1984; Sato, et al., 1984, 1986; Sugisaki,

1984; Sugisaki, et al., 1983). The precise origin of this "active
fault" hydrogen continues to be debated, but most investigators have
attributed it to either the active shearing of water-rich minerals,
or the release of "pent-up" hydrogen generated by the FeO/hydration
(serpentinization) reaction mentioned above.

Helium and hydrogen, because of their small molecular sizes,
low solubilities in ground water, and low chemical reactivities, are
very mobile gases once generated (Hunt, 1979; McGee, et al., 1983).
They are, therefore, capable of diffusing through all geologic
materials over time, although these diffusion rates are generally
low. Because of this high mobility, they cannot be retained in
traditional geologic traps for long times geologically, and their
presense in deeper subsurface gases (the Heins and Scott wells for
example) implies continuous abiogentic generation at shallow crustal
or deeper levels is taking place (Hunt, 1979; Rodgers and Anderson,
1984, p. 96). Although diffusion rates are generally low, higher
gas-flux rates of several orders of magnitude are predicted for
gases moving upward at depth along faults and fracture zones due to

their fracture-enhanced permeability (Cunningham, et al., 1987, p.

213; Gold and Held, 1987, p. 419; Ware, et al., 1984). High ampli
45

ee ey A el AS 9S 8 AE TT TS

tude, very localized (often single point) helium and hydrogen anomalies detected in soil gas surveys are thus interpreted to reflect
such higher flux rates along near-surface fault zones (Cunninghan,

t al., 1987, p. 213; Driver and Brodine, 1985; Eremeev,

eb ab t al.,

1973; Jones and Drozd 1983; Ovchinnikov, et al., 1972). In addi
tion, Shcherbakov and Kozlova (1986) reviewed a large number of
subsurface Russian hydrogen occurrences and concluded (p. 126) that
most anomalies occur in association with "zones of deep regional
faults". Angino (1985) pointed out that many of the Kansas soil gas
hydrogen anomalies acquired up until that time (now considered
fairly small) occurred near the centers of river and stream valleys.
McCarthy and others (1986, p. 17) speculated that this association
indicated fault control on the near-surface migration of the Kansas
hydrogen gas. In regional soil gas surveys with sample spacings of
1 to 2 miles (spacings for this study average 0.5 to 1.0 mi.) highly
anomalous values are generally seperated from the statistically less
anomalous background values prior to mapping in order to emphasize
the larger regional trends that may relate to actual petroleum or
other commodity deposit signatures (see for example Cunningham, et
al., 1987). Alternatively, with close enough sample spacing (10-200
feet), the locations of these highly anomalous points can generally
be used to actually map indirectly individual fracture and fault

zones (Roberts and Roen, 1985).

METHODOLOGY

Imagery Analysis

Two general types of remotely sensed imagery were utilized in
this study. These consisted of various Landsat products and lowaltitude airphoto mosaics.

Landsat imagery in three formats was utilized in this study
(Table 1). All images were selected on the basis of minimal cloud
cover conditions, good to excellent image quality, and appropriate
geographic coverage. The band 5 (near infrared) Thematic Mapper
(TM) image dated Jan. 13, 1985 was also selected on the basis of the
superior spatial resolution provided by this sensor and reported
snow-on-ground measurements over the study area. According to the
U.S. Weather Service (verbal comm., 1985) Jan. 10, 1985 snow cover
ranged in thickness from about 44 cm (17 in.) at Concordia in Cloud
County through 30 cm (12 in.) at Milford Lake in Geary County to 20
em (8 in.) at Cottonwood Falls in Chase County. It was felt that
such extensive snow cover and the low sun angle (23 degrees) would
help obscure cultural features and reveal certain, otherwise subtle,
topographic elements (Halbouty, 1976, p. 764; Morrison, 1976). The
band 6 (thermal infrared) TM image dated Aug. 12, 1983 was obtained
because it was felt that the minor drought conditions prevailing
over the study area during the acquisition period would enhance
those areas of anomalous vegetational stress (expressed as leaf
surface temperature) resulting from the increased soil-moisture

conditions expected near lineaments (Berger and Aghassy, 1984; Run

sey, 1971, p. 31-32). ‘The two Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) images were
selected for the high spatial resolution provided by the sensor and
the low sun angle conditions (32 and 44 degrees) during their acquisition dates.

The interpretation procedure for all Landsat image products was
similar to that employed by Anderson (1981, p. 14-19) and Roark
(1985, p. 22-23). A single transparent mylar overlay was attached
to each image and several prominant river junctions or other distinctive landmarks were marked to aid in later registration of all
overlays. Interpreted photolineaments were traced onto these overlays with a "00" Rapidograph ink pen and the aid of a straightedge.
Positive prints were viewed under reflected fluorescent light conditions and transparencies were viewed using the transmitted light of
a commercial fluorescent light table. Viewing was done at both low
and high observation angles in an otherwise darkened room and all
extraneous sources of light were eliminated to reduce eye fatigue.
Various combinations of transparent colored acetate sheets (red,
yellow, green, blue) were utilized to filter both sources of light
(Peterson, 1979, p. 1000). In addition a 79 lines/cm (200
lines/inch) Ronchi ruling was used to aid in the locating of subtle
alignments (Pohn, 1978). Each image was viewed for a period of 10
to 15 minutes (Caran et al., 1981) and reexamined two additional
times on later dates. All linear features were evaluated on airphoto mosaics (see below) to eliminate cultural features. Finally,
all photolineaments observed on two different images, or at least

twice on the same image, were transfered to a final overlay (Plate

49

2) with the aid of an optical enlarging/reducing table.

In addition to photolineaments determined by the above procedure, all linear features mapped in previous Landsat studies overlapping the study area (Callen, 1983; Cooley, 1984; McCauley, et
al., 1978) were reevaluated on the higher resolution imagery available to this study and many of these features also appear on Plate
2. This was done in an attempt to reduce "single-operator bias"
(Podwysocki, et al., 1975; Siegel, 1977).

Black-and-white panchromatic aerial photomosaics of the type
prepared by the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service (ASCS) and its predecessors, the U.S. Commodity Stabilization Service (CSS), the U.S. Production and Marketing Administration
(PMA) and the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA),
acquired between 1938 and 1973, were made available to the author by
the Kansas Applied Remote Sensing Center (KARS), the Remote Sensing
Laboratory (RSL) of the University of Kansas, and the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) for each county of the entire study area. In
spite of some slight inherent geometric distortions, the airphoto
mosaics proved invaluable for evaluating the geomorphic validity
(ie. not cultural effects) and possible geologic causes of Landsatderived features, because these large-scale images were readily
available, and provided both good spectral definition and excellent

spatial resolution (Peterson, 1979, p. 998).

Drainage Analysis

Linear elements of the study area drainage network represent a

50
subset of data derived from an earlier study. Details of the mapping methodology, compilation, and possible interpretations of these
data are available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987). In general,
these data represent a combination of the linear drainage segments
of the study area drainage network as portrayed on the 1,000,000scale U.S. Geological Survey base map of Kansas and the 1:250,000scale U.S. Geological Survey Manhattan and Hutchinson topographic
map sheets. The drainage lines on these maps were originally traced
from aerial photos and are thus portrayed in considerable detail. A
map of these linear segments is not included herein. However, the
drainage network as portrayed on the 1:2500,000-scale maps is available (Plate 2) for comparison with the linear features obtained from

the other data sources.

Gravity Data

Gravity data used in the present study comprise a subset of an
ongoing state-wide gravity survey being conducted by the Kansas
Geological Survey. Within the study area data were acquired by the
Survey over a period of several years using a Worden gravimeter a
stations located every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) or 3.2 km (2.0 mi.) along
east-west transects spaced either 9.6 km (6 mi.) or 6.4 km (4 mi.)
apart respectively (see Lam, 1987, Fig. 6 for actual station locations). These relative gravity measurements were tied into the
International Gravity Standardization Net to establish absolute
gravity values. Earth tide, meter drift, free-air, and Bouguer

corrections were applied using a Bouguer density value of 2.67

51

gm/cm?. Terrain corrections were not performed due to the low
topographic relief of Kansas. Gridding of the data at 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) allowed for spectral domain filtering (see
below) to produce various map products. Estimated overall accuracy
of the final gridded data is thought to be better than 0.5 mgal
(Lam, 1987).

Gravity map products used in this study were produced by digital filtering of an appropriate subset of the Kansas gravity dataset. Filtering operations applied included calculation and removal
of a tenth-order trend surface, as used by Lam (1987, p. 133) to
enhance the contributions of shallow basement sources, and produc
t al.,

tion of two low-angle synthetic illumination images (Yarger,
1984) at "sun" azimuths of 120 degrees (ESE) and 235 degrees (SW) of
north to enhance NNE-trending and NW-trending features respectively
(for state-wide examples of these products see Lam, 1987). The
orientations for these latter two filters were selected on the basis
of two distinct maxima in the orientation plot of Lam’s (1987, Fig.
38) gravity lineaments of eastern Kansas (recompiled: here as Figure
12A). Paper copies and color plots of the resultant images were
plotted at a scale of 1:250,000 using the Kansas Geological Survey's
Versatek plotter and at a scale of 1:1,000,000 with the Survey's
Tektronics color plotter, respectively.

Mylar overlays were then placed over each map and the trends
and lengths of all apparent linear gravity features were traced onto
them. The final map (Plate 3) represents a composite of all linear

features appearing at least twice on these overlays. In addition,

52

“

the linear features of Lam (1987, p. 143, Figure 11 here) were
reevaluated on the study area plots and retraced at the new scale

when considered appropriate.

Aeromagnetic Data

Aeromagnetic data used in this study are part of a high-quality
aeromagnetic survey of the entire state of Kansas completed by the
Kansas Geological Survey between 1975 and 1979. Data were acquired
with an airborne proton-precession magnetometer at a nominal elevation of 762 m (2500 ft.) above sea level along east-west flight
lines with a 3.2 km (2 mi.) spacing and a 2.0 second sample rate.
Resultant measurements were thus spaced about every 0.16 km (0.1
mi.) along track. Data were subsequently regridded to 1.6 km by 1.6
km (1.0 mi. by 1.0 mi.) using a nearest neighbor approach and are
believed to be accurate to about 5 nanoteslas (5 gammas). /Yarger
(1981, 1983) gives additional details on acquisition and reduction
of the basic dataset.

The aeromagnetic map products used in the present study were
produced from a subset of the state-wide dataset using existing Fast
Fourier Transform computer routines on the Kansas Geological Survey's Data General computer. Yarger (1981, 1983) utilized the same
algorithms to produce a set of digital images for interpreting the
gross features of the state’s magnetic field. Processing procedures
applied in this study included “reduction to the pole", "downward
continuation", "second vertical derivative", and “synthetic illumi
nation" (for state-wide examples of these products see Yarger,

53


1983). Reduction to the pole is used to remove the effect of the
earth’s inclined magnetic pole and thereby improves the resolution
of anomaly locations. Downward continuation is a mathematical procedure to calculate the magnetic field at a specified elevation
below the original measurement plane and has the effect of enhancing
shallow basement anomalies. Since the rock bodies responsible for
these near-surface anomalies are the ones most likely to have produced structural deformation in the overlying strata, this operation
was applied to the data. Magnetic data were "downward continued" to
2,000 feet below sea level, the approximate average top of the
Precambrian surface in the study area. The second vertical derivative of the magnetic field is often useful for enhancing nearvertical contacts between materials of differing magnetic properties
(Vacquier, et al., 1951) and was therefore thought to be particularly useful for defining possible intra-basement faults in the study
area. The prominent orientations of eastern Kansas linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28) for eastern Kansas (Figure
12B) are strikingly similar to the trends of eastern Kansas gravity
lineaments (Figure 12A) as mapped by Lam (1987, p. 147). Therefore,
synthetic illumination using the same "sun angles" as in the gravity
processing (see above), was used to enhance study area magnetic
features.

A similar set of contour and color plots was again obtained and
a series of mylar overlays were prepared by tracing all lines representing linear magnetic features onto them. The final map of magne
tic lineaments (Plate 3) also represents a composite of linements

54
observed on two or more images. Here again, those linear magnetic
features mapped by Yarger (1983, p. 28, Figure 10 here) in the study
area were also reevaluated and many were retraced onto the final

overlay at the new scale.

Earthquake Foci Data

Data on earthquake and microquake epicenter locations used in
this study (Tables 2 and 3 respectively) were taken from published
sources (DuBois and Wilson, 1978; Steeples, et al., 1987) and recent
unpublished data on file at the Kansas Geological Survey (Greg
Hildebrand, written comm., May 6, 1988). Historic earthquake epicenter data of DuBois and Wilson was originally compiled from written descriptions by earthquake witnesses and damage accounts, and
are presented in Modified Mercalli magnitudes. Because of the
somewhat subjective and imprecise nature of these records, epicenter
locations as plotted (Plate 1) may be subject to considerable locational error. Microquake data has been acquired by a local seismograph network only since 1977 and event magnitudes are recorded in
Richter scale units. Epicenters of these events are located with
greater precision. A discussion of root-mean-squared locational
errors and estimated focal depths is available elsewhere (Steeples,

et al., 1987). Relative to the interpretation of distinct clusters

of epicentral locations (Plate 1), Steeples (1982) has stated (p.
73) that “the trends of microquake activity [in Kansas] define zones

in the basement, where sufficient fault-related permeability might

exist to allow the circulation of fluids from the deep crust."

structural Information

Prior to drafting Plate 4, the author prepared a revised version (not atiown} of Cole’s (1976) and Sims’ (1985) maps of the
Precambrain surface. Well control for this map consisted of about
280 oil and gas tests that penetrated the Precambrian and was taken
primarily from Cole and Watney (1985), with post-1983 data provided
by the University of Kansas, Project Upper Crust (Lanny Lathan,
written comm., May 11, 1988), and the Kansas Geological Survey (Lynn
Watney, written comm., May 13, 1988). In addition to basement
faults mapped by Cole and Sims, the locations of known or suspected
faults mapped in overlying strata (Berendsen and Blair, 1986, Map 6;
Curtis, 1960; Newell, 1987) were extended down to the Precambrain
surface following the assumption of Berendsen and Blair (1986, p. 3)
that "a fault present in a mapped unit must cut the underlying older
rocks as well." On Plate 4 these "probable faults" appear to be
concentrated along the Nemaha uplift because of the fairly high
drilling density there and very limited well control over the remainder of the area. Additionally, linear structural trends on the
revised basement map that could conceivably represent faults were
annotated on this map in much the same fashion as Berendsen and
others (1978, Fig. 3) treated Cole’s (1976) map. Features portrayed
as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4 are thus a composite of
those mapped by Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18, reproduced as
Figure 4 here) and additional basement fractures interpreted in this
study from the above-mentioned basement structure trends, and linea
ments interpreted from geophysical, remotely sensed, drainage, and

58

earthquake foci data (see Discussion section below).

Soil Gas Data

Soil gas measurements used in the present investigation (Plate
1) represent a composite of 190 soil gas hydrogen values obtained by
the U.S. Geological Survey in July, 1984 (McCarthy, et al., 1986;
McCauley and Watney, 1984) and an as yet unpublished dataset of just
over 400 measurements acquired since that time by Ernest E. Angino
and coworkers as part of an ongoing study of the Kansas hydrogen
occurrence. Soil gas samples and hydrogen determinations for these
two studies were obtained by different techniques.

The procedure used by the U.S. Geological Survey has been
described in considerable detail by McCarthy and others (1986, p.
9). In general, it consisted of driving a 0.75 m (2.5 ft.) long

(0.3 in?) gas

hollow steel probe in the soil, withdrawing a 5 cm
sample with a syringe, and analyzing it immediately in a truckmounted mass spectrometer. This uncalibrated procedure produced
measurements of relative hydrogen concentration only. Values reported here as "small anomalies" and "medium anomalies" on Plate 4 from
this dataset are those considered "possible anomalies" and "anomalies" by McCauley and Watney (1984, Fig. 5B, 10) on the basis of
degree of positive deviation from their daily (downward) trends.
The very shallow nature of their sampling depth probably produced
considerable diurnal variations in hydrogen concentrations (Gole and

Butt, 1985, p. 2112; Sato, et al., 1986, p. 12,321) which they

apparently did not attempt to account for. The deeper sampling of

59

the Angino group was an attempt to overcome this problem.

The methodology of Angino and coworkers has not been previously
described and is outlined here (Ernest E. Angino, verbal comm., May
27, 1988). Trailer or truck-mounted power soil augers were used to
drill 5 cm (2 in.) diameter holes to average depths of about 3 m (10
ft.) [actual range = 2-4.5 m (6-14 ft.)] at locations on private
lands spaced about every 1.6 km (1.0 mi.) [locally 0.8 km (0.5 mi.)]
along sample traverse roads (Plate 1). Holes were cased with conmercially available 5 cm (2 in.) diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
pipes of an appropriate length. PVC pipes had been slotted on the
lower 60 cm (2 ft.) and were fitted on the top with a septunequipted PVC end cap. Pipes were pumped to partial vacuum and left
undisturbed for a period of about 15 minutes, allowing soil gasses
to collect within the pipes. Gas samples were then withdrawn
through the septa with a 100 cm? (6.0 in.?) syringe and analyzed
immediately in portable gas chromatographs. 269 analyses were performed prior to the 1987 field year and utilized a Hewlett Packard
5890A model gas chromatograph having a thermal conductivity detector
and a 1 meter capillary column. This technique produced only relative measurements of soil gas hydrogen concentrations (sample locations indicated as "Relative Values" on Plate 1). Gas analyses
performed since that time utilized a field-ruggedized, HNU Series
301 model portable gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity
detector and a 4 meter capillary column. Alternate analyses of 100
cm? (6.0 in.) samples of a calibrated gas standard (stated concen
trations of 1000 ppm + 1% Hy, 500 ppm +1% He) during this latter

60

cs

period allowed absolute determinations of 135 hydrogen concentrations to be made (sample locations marked “Absolute Values" on Plate
1). Sdhsequent vesenp ling of some of the older, "relative" stations
empirically demonstrated a nearly linear relationship existed between the two types of measurements.

To facilitate comparison of hydrogen anomaly magnitudes from
these two sources, highly anomalous measurements were grouped into 4
relative classes in an approach that differs slightly from that of
Cunningham and others (1987, p. 218). The population means and
standard deviations of each group ("Relative Values", and "Absolute
Values") were determined seperately (Figure 13), and all values
exceeding the mean for the data type were considered anomalous for
mapping purposes. All measurements below the mean for each data
type were considered to represent a regional "background" population
(although quite high by global standards, see for example Ware, et
al., 1984), and are portrayed on Plate 4 accordingly. Measurements
between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and those greater than 3 standard
deviations above the population mean for each respective group are
portrayed on Plate 4 as "small", "medium", and "large" anomalies
respectively. Interestingly, 32% of the values of each group exceed
the corresponding means and are thus considered anomalous. This may
be an indication that both populations represent statistically valid
samples of a single population in spite of slightly different gas

sampling procedures and analytical techniques.

RESULTS

Drainage Analysis

Analysis of drainage network maps for that portion of Kansas
lying between 38 an 40 degrees north latitude and 96 and 98 degrees
west longitude (including all of the present study area) was completed at an early stage in this investigation and resulted in the
delineation of 644 linear stream segments totaling 6023 km (3743
mi.) in length from all drainage basins exceeding 10 kin? (3.9 mi.)
in area. A more detailed discussion of the results from this analySis is available elsewhere (Johnsgard, 1986, 1987), but, in general,
the correlation of the single broad north-south mode in this data
with known geologic controls was found to be poor. Nonetheless, a
length-weighted azimuthal histogram ("rose diagram") has been compiled in 10 degree increments from the linear drainage segments
mapped during that investigation and is included here (Figure 14B)
for comparison with other linear feature data.

Length-weighted values, as opposed to simple orientation frequencies, were utilized in compiling the drainage rose diagram, and
all subsequent diagrams, because this approach permits direct quantitative comparisons of orientation tendencies for many data types
to be made, regardless of sample size. In addition, correlation
coefficients between linear-feature orientation frequency and cummulative length for each data type are all slightly positive (eg. for
drainage alignments, r = +0.11), indicating that those linear fea
tures possessing the more abundant orientations also tend to be

63

slightly longer. These two factors (length-weighting, and positive
length/frequency correlations) are additive and thus tend to produce
fairly "spikey" rose diagrams. Note also that the radial scales (in
percentage by length) of these diagrams vary from figure to figure
in order to portray the maximum rays of each diagram at approximately similar physical lengths, further facilitating comparison of
the different types of data. During examination of these rose
diagrams, the reader should bear in mind that a truly random distribution of linear element orientations would statistically tend to
produce a rose diagram with all 18 rays of approximately 5.6% in
length (100% / 18 rays = 5.6% / ray).
Imagery Analysis

Analysis of study area Landsat imagery produced a sompogite of
242 straight or nearly straight photolineaments totaling 2132 km
(1325 mi.) in length and 50 distinctly curved photolineaments.
Comparison of these photolineaments with the drainage network (Plate
2) shows that almost all photolineaments of both types correspond to
linear or semicircular drainage features respectively. This finding
concurs with most previous studies reported in the literature.
Given that most of these features correspond with surface drainage
elements, the locations of which are precisely defined, both the
locational accuracy and orientational precision of these features
are considered very good. Some of the strongly curved photolineaments ("curvilineaments" of some other authors) also appear to
correlate with structural domes, horsts, or grabens as mapped by

Berendsen and Blair (1986), and Cole (1976) along the Nemaha anti
65

cline, and, to a lesser degree, with circular aeromagnetic (Yarger,
et al., 1981) or gravity (Yarger, et al., 1985) anomalies. Other
than these general observations, further analysis of the possible
tectonic significance of curved photolineaments was not attempted.

Cursory examination of Plate 2 reveals that two fairly distinct
azimuthal modes are present in the straight photolineament data.
These trends have been quantified with a length-weighted rose diagram (Figure 14A) of their orientations. Because of the obvious
difficulties and dubious value in determining average azimuthal
values for the strongly curved photolineaments, these features have
been excluded from this compilation. One wide, but fairly distinct,
mode occurs at about N.10°E. A less prominant and narrower mode
occurs at about N.40°W. Note that neither of these modal orientations agrees well with any of the well-documented regional joint
trends (N.60-75°E., N.10-35°W., and N.70-83°W.) of the eastern
Kansas-Oklahoma area as discussed above.

This bimodal distribution of study area photolineaments resembles fairly closely the results of Anderson's (1981, Fig. 7b) study
of Landsat photolineaments in an adjoining area of southeastern
Nebraska, although his modes appear to be offset clockwise by about
20 and 10 degrees respectively. In addition, he interpreted (p. 19)
a broad northeastern maximum to represent a composite of two narrower modes. From extensive comparisons with many possible geologic
causes, he concluded that many of the photolineaments could mark the
surface traces of a periodically rejuvinated regional basement frac
ture system.

66

These two prominant modes at N.40°W. and N.30°E., as well as
two less frequent modal orientations of N.15°W. and N.65-70°E., were
also present in the Landsat photolineaments mapped by Dwivedi
(1983). He attributed both sets of photolineaments to a conjugate
fracture system produced by wrench faulting of the Nemaha anticline
and related structures near his study area in south-central Kansas.
Jefferis (1969, Fig. 10A) also documented a nearly identical N.40°W.
mode and a N.50°E. mode in radar photolineaments from southern Douglas County which he ascribed (p. 31) to "major faults and zones of
fracture concentrations." Callen (1983) mapped a large number of
Landsat photolineaments in the Forest City basin and concluded that
at least two individual features in Atchison, Jefferson, and Leavenworth counties, Kansas, reflected two previously unrecognized northeast and northwest-oriented basement faults. He later (1985) used
several basinwide trend surface maps of mean photolineament azimuths
to infer a distinct influence of the Missouri gravity low on the
structural development of the basin.

Orientation statistics have apparently never been compiled for
the remainder of the major photolineament studies in Kansas (Cooley,
1984, 1986; McCauley, 1988; McCauley, et al., 1978; Podwysocki,
1974), but visual examination of each these maps demonstrates that
both the northeast and northwest modes are regionally pervasive.
For example, Cooley (1984) mapped a large number of Landsat photolineaments in western Kansas, and that portion of his map which
overlaps the southwestern corner of the study area is presented here

(Figure 15). Note that, although photolineaments with virtually

every orientation are present, north-northeast and northwest-oriented features are much more abundant and tend to be considerably
longer than the others. Although it is fairly obvious that not
every single one of the photolineaments he mapped corresponds to an
actual geologic or structural feature, it is apparent that a nonrandom componant is certainly present and it does at least seem likely

that it could reflect such a genetic origin.

Gravity and Magnetic Features

Upon initial examination of Plate 3 it is readily apparent that
two prominant orientations also exist for both types of linear
geophysical elements mapped. Compilations of the 71 gravity lineaments totaling 1687 km (1048 mi.) in length , and 94 magnetic lineaments 2560 km (1591 mi.) in cumulative length (Figure 16) appearing
on this map serve to clarify these two prominant modes. These modes
are nearly identical in both orientation and magnitude on both rose
diagrams, and correlate well with the modes determined by Lam (1987)
for gravity and Yarger (1983) for aeromagnetic lineaments in eastern
Kansas (Figure 12). They are also remarkably similar to the modes
determined for photolineaments above. Given the reasonable spatial
resolution of the original aeromagnetic data (see Methodology section), the locational and orientational precisions of the magnetic
features are considered fairly good, although not as good as photolineament data. However, the wide spacing of gravity stations over
most of the study area (see Methodology section) probably degraded

gravity feature locational and, to a lesser extent, orientational

69

od

accuracies considerably.

With closer examination of Plates 2 and 3, it becomes apparent
that the patterns of linear features in the northwestern half of
each map differ somewhat from those present in the southeastern
halves. A more-or-less distinct discontinuity between these patterns appears to correspond with the location of the eastern flank
of the Abilene anticline. Additional rose diagrams have thus been
compiled for Landsat (Figure 17), gravity (Figure 18), and magnetic
(Figure 19) features with respect to whether they have been mapped
northwest of, or southeast of, the Abilene anticline. Although both
of the prominant modes mentioned above are still apparent in both
gravity and magnetic trends, their relative importance is reversed
across the Abilene structure. Northwest-oriented geophysical features predominate in the eastern portion of the maps, whereas northnortheast trending features are considerably more abundant to the
west. This is also true for Landsat photolineaments, but the northnortheast mode has shifted to nearly due north for photolineaments
in the western half of Plate 2. The possible significance of this

shift is not understood.

Basement Structure

The 49 linear features, totaling 1505 km (935 mi.) in length,
mapped on the revised contour map of basement configuration (see
Methodology section) are shown on Plate 3 and their orientations are
compiled on Figure 20A. Again note a prominant mode centered on

N.30-40°E. and a very small secondary mode at about N.50°W.

71

DISCUSSION

Structural Interpretations

In general, with the possible exception of drainage trends,
each of the foregoing compilations of data appears distinctly bimodal, with prominant modes at about N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This
close correlation of orientation statistics for linear features
extracted from such widely differing basic data sources [ie. certain
river and stream orientations (linear drainage segments) and areal
spectral reflectance characteristics (Landsat photolineaments),
areal variations in rock magnetic properties (magnetic lineaments)
and rock density (gravity lineaments), and basement surface configuration (linear structural trends)] implies a similar genetic cause.
Comparison of these features with the locations (Plate 4) and orientations (Figure 20B) of the 73 probable study area faults as
previously mapped using subsurface data by Berendsen and Blair
(1986) and Newell (1987) indicates a close correlation exists here
also, again implying a causal relationship. Many of the gravity and
magnetic linear features mapped elsewhere in Kansas are thought to
correspond in both orientation and location with basement discontinuities controlled by faults and anticlines (see Introduction and
Methodology sections above). Therefore, I suggest that the two
prominant modes for linear features in the structural, geophysical,
and remotely sensed data sets of the study area also reflect a
bimodal basement fracture and fault system. Thus, all features por
trayed as "possible faults or fractures" on Plate 4, with the excep
76

tion those modified after Berendsen and others (1988, Fig. 18,
presented here as Figure 4 in Introduction section), have been
inferred on the basis of linear features on recorded on Plates 2 and
3. In general, the locations of most of these "possible faults or
fractures" were interpreted from any combination of spatially coincident gravity lineaments, aeromagnetic lineaments, structural lineaments, linear drainage segments, or Landsat photolineaments. Some
were inferred on the basis of aeromagnetic lineaments alone, particularly those oriented either NW or NNE, and a few represent linear
features that correlated well with the extensions of previously
mapped subsurface faults. A discussion of each feature and contributing data sources would be too lengthy to include here, so the
reader is urged to consult the source maps (Plates 2, and 3) for the
following discussion and during evaluation of the interpretative map
(Plate 4).

Many, perhaps most, of the northwest-oriented fractures in the
eastern portion of Plate 4 are probably genetically related to a set
of similarly oriented basement fault zones previously infered to
exist in the granitic basement over much of eastern Kansas and
western Missouri (Berendsen and Blair, 1984; Berendsen, et al.,
1978; Kisvarsanyi, 1974; McCracken, 1971). One of these, the
Bolivar-Mansfield fault zone (Plate 4), appears to intersect the
Nemaha anticline in a structurally complex portion near southeast
Riley County and continues westward through the Abilene anticline
very close to several of the Riley County kimberlites (Berendsen, et

al., 1988, p. 16). These northwest-oriented fractures parallel the

77

~

bounding faults of the Missouri gravity low and it seems possible
that this fault set could represent a Phanerozoic structural event
imposed. on the basement rocks of the region, or could have
originated from tensional fracturing of the upper crust during the
middle? Proterozoic (>1,350 to 1,485 Ma) tectonic event thought to
be responsible for producing the Missouri gravity low. It also
seems possible that the locations and orientations of these faults,
as well as the overall trend of the Missouri gravity low, may
reflect regionally pervasive set of even older crustal weaknesses.
These weaknesses could also have resulted from the roughly dated
(1,800 to 1,400 Ma ?) middle Proterozoic shearing episode discussed
above (see Introduction section), or could conceivably have been
incurred even earlier during early Proterozoic accretion of the
Central Plains province itself (Bickford, et al., 1986, p. 494).
Yarger (1983, p. 27) has stated that most of the northwest-oriented
aeromagnetic features of eastern are interupted at the rift by the
north-northeast features which characterize this zone, implying that
"the northwest grain is older than the rift." Alternatively, the
mechanism which produced the northwest set could postdate formation
of the rift and have simply failed to produce many of these features
within the preexisting rift zone.

Likewise, many of the inferred north-northeast oriented
fractures, so pervasive along the Nemaha anticline and west of the
Abilene anticline, probably correspond with basement fault zones
trending parallel to the Midcontinent rift system axial zone and may

have resulted from tensional stresses associated with middle Proter
78

ozoic (about 1,100 to 950 Ma) formation of this rift, although they
too may reflect earlier crustal anisotropy.

The. north-northeast-oriented fractures show an apparent tendency (Plate 4) to be expressed as zones of fairly closely spaced
fractures (notably the Nemaha and Abilene anticlines, Washington
structure, and possibly the Belleville fault) seperated by wide
areas of relatively unfractured basement. Of these four zones, two
(Nemaha and Belleville) are spatially coincident with abundant historic seismic activity (Plate 1). The former is expressed by over
1,000 m (3,000 ft.) of vertical Phanerozoic fault displacement and
the latter corresponds with the traditionally mapped western limit
of the Rice Formation (Bickford, et al., 1979). The other two
features (Abilene and Washington) have been interpreted as _ the
eastern and western boundaries of rift-related mafic basement rocks
respectively (eg. see Bickford, et al., 1979), and correspond with

both the steepest gradients on the central gravity high of Bouguer

t al., 1985) and distinct discontinuities

gravity maps (eg. Yarger,
on aeromagnetic images of the study area (eg. Yarger, et al., 1981).
In addition, the Abilene anticline was observed (see Results section) to mark the boundary between two distinct areas of linearfeature characteristics, but shows only about 100 m (300 ft.) of
Phanerozoic vertical displacement.

I believe these latter two features (Abilene and Washington)
reflect deep crustal zones that acted as fundamental controls on the

location and structure of the rift zone during extension, including

magma intrusion and extrusion, but are no longer very active tecton
79
ically (as shown structurally and seismically), perhaps because of
"healing" by the extensive rift-related magmatism. The proximity of
the Riley County (Cretaceous age) kimberlites to the Abilene anticline could reflect this deep crustal fracturing. The other two
features (Nemaha and Belleville) could have acted as important
controls on rift-basin and post-rift basement geometry, affecting
the locations of the "east Rice basin" and "west Rice basin", but
were sufficiently distal from active rift magmatism that they have
remained zones of deep crustal weakness through the present.

Taken together these two infered fault sets comprise a well
defined "gridded fault pattern" similar to that proposed for the
northern portion of the Midcontinent rift in Michigan, Minnesota,
and Wisconsin (McSwiggen, et al., 1987; Van Schmus and Hinze, 1985)
and typical of continental rifts in general (Ramberg and Smithson,
1975). This bimodal fracture system could segment the upper crust
of northern Kansas into large orthogonal blocks, as has been suggested for elsewhere in the Midcontinent (eg. Zabawa, 1978). It is
probable, given the relatively thin cover of Phanerozoic sediments
relative to the thick Precambrian crust, that such a pervasive
system of deep fractures (particularly the unhealed rift marginal
sets) could have been periodically reactivated by external tectonic
stresses through time (Ford, 1983). Theoretically at least, the
orientation of any individual fracture plane relative to these
stresses would determine the style of deformation (normal, reverse,
strike-slip, or a combination thereof) associated with any rejuvina
tion event (Peterson, 1985a, 1985b). The complex fault geometries

80

and horst/graben structures presently associated with some of these
fault zones (eg. Humboldt fault zone) may represent near-surface
fault splays resulting from several episodes of convergent wrench
movement along the deeply seated (possibly listric) rift-marginal
master faults (see Wilcox, et al ., 1973, Fig. 15; Zabawa, 1978,
Fig. 27). Episodic reactivation of such zones could also have
produced differential uplift or downdropping of larger crustal
blocks, causing local paleobathymetric and paleotopographic relief
(Gustavson, 1983). Such irregularities might have resulted in important lithologic and structural trends in the overlying Phanerozoic sedimentary package, particularly in water-depth sensitive
near-shore settings (see Introduction section). With adequate constraints on paleostress fields and fracture orientations it might be
possible to predict deformational styles and related lithostratigraphic influences (including petroleum trapping potential) in the
Phanerozoic rocks of the poorly explored, deeper portions of the
Salina basin (Berendsen, et al., 1988, p. 4; Newell, et al., 1988b).
Conversely, in areas of sufficient control, such as along certain
portions of the Nemaha structure, consideration of fault plane
geometries and associated lithotectonic expressions of deformational
styles could perhaps serve to confirm or refute reconstructions of
regional paleostress fields.

The spatial proximity of modern seismicity (Plate 1) to many of
these supposed faults (Humboldt fault zone, Belleville fault, and,
of particular note, the Poersch fault) strongly suggests that move
ment continues along at least some of them at present. Such activi
81

ty could be responsible for propagating these fracture zones upward
to the present land surface, perhaps in the form of zones of more
intense jointing or more rarely as actual faults with stratigraphic
offsets, where they are now expressed as modern drainage alignments
and photolineaments. The overall lack of resistant beds in the
Wellington Formation and the resultant paucity of outcrops over much
of the central portion of the study area (where the largest hydrogen
anomalies occur) precluded evaluation of this hypothesis in the
field using a suitable approach for detecting such zones (for example see Wheeler and Dixon, 1980).

If such intensely jointed zones do exist, however, they could
theoretically provide enhanced permeability pathways for vertically
moving free hydrogen gas or gas-charged fluids. It is also likely
that their ages and tectonic history could have produced different
internal geometries, thereby affecting relative permeabilities
(Schrauf and Evans, 1984). Furthermore, their three dimensional
orientations relative to the modern horizontal stress field should
profoundly influence their fluid conductivity characteristics (Merin
and Moore, 1986). Internal geometry factors (age, genetic origin,
etc.) being equal, those fracture zones oriented subparallel with
the modern principal horizontal stress (ie. approximately eastnortheast) would be expected to be the most "open" to vertically

migrating fluids.

Visual inspection of the locations of linear features (Plates 2

82
~
and 3), infered fractures (Plate 4), and anomolous soil gas samples
(Plate 4) reveals that many of the "medium," "large," and "very
large" hydrogen anomalies occur on, very near, or along the extensions of linear features and suspected fractures. Of particular
note are several anomalies located along the two infered faults
bounding the northern extension of the Lindsborg anticline, numerous
anomalies along the Chapman Creek fracture, and several anomalies
(including the largest “relative" sample of all) located near the
Poersch fault mentioned above. Additional examples could be cited.
Some "small" anomalies also appear to be spatially correlated with
such features. Given the large sample spacing (0.5 to 1.0 mi.),
these findings are somewhat surprising, and suggest a slightly positive correlation may exist between anomaly magnitudes and their
relative proximities to linear features in spite of the coarse sample spacing. However, note that a large number of nonanomalous
values also occur close to linear features. This relationship has
been noted in other studies. Richers and others (1986, Fig. 13)
provided a hypothetical fracture model that can account for these
observations (Figure 21 here). Additional soil-gas sampling at
close intervals (50 to 200 ft.) across one or more of the above
mentioned specific features might serve as a test of the model in
Kansas. Sampling across the trace of a surface fault documented in
Ottawa County (Hoppie, 1980; Mack, 1962) that parallels the inferred
northwest-oriented fracture set, and might help establish the relative importance of actual fault zones as hydrogen conduits (Ware, et

al., 1984) for the Kansas occurrence. Smoothed regional trends of

likely to reflect the gross geometry of deep source areas or zones,
than localized near-surface transportation routes.

I believe that the apparent correlation between fracture locations and hydrogen soil-gas anomaly magnitudes, however slight, does
reflect vertical movement of the gas through basement fault and
fracture zones into corresponding (implied, but as yet undocumented)
near-surface fracture zones. Probably the most accurate, and perhaps only, way to verify the existance and nature of these infered
fracture zones, to quantify their various permeability factors, and
determine their relative importance as hydrogen conduits would be to
actually penetrate several of these zones with appropriately located
boreholes utilizing deviated drilling techniques (Figure 22), and
perform relevant core analyses and drillstem tests. Among the particular features to be recomended for such testing at this point are
the inferred Chapman Creek fracture zone, faults flanking the Lindsborg anticline (eg. Salina fault), the Poersch fault, and any other
pronounced anomaly/linear feature combinations detected by additional soil-gas sampling. Assuming such zones were penetrated and
showed evidence of substantially enhanced hydrogen movement, determination of the presence or absence of a reasonably hydrogen-impermeable sealing horizon (salt?, bentonitic shale?) could affect the
potential exploitability of the occurrence. And finally, if the
viability of a hydrogen resource could be demonstrated, additional
reconnaissance-level soil-gas sampling and down-hole testing along

much of the Midcontinent rift system might be warranted.

CONCLUSIONS

Fracture Pattern

The Precambrian basement rocks of the study area are typified
by a bimodally distributed fracture pattern with modal orientations
close to N.40-50°W. and N.10-30°E. This bimodal fracture pattern is
expressed as linear trends in gravity and aeromagnetic data, earthquake foci locations, structural surfaces, kimberlite axes, and as
stratigraphic offsets in seismic data. Surficial indications of it,
such as drainage alignments and spatial variations in spectral
response as detected by Landsat (ie. photolineaments), may reflect
zones of increased near-surface joint intensity over deeper fault
zones.

The northwest-oriented fracture set is apparently the older set
and may date from tensional forces associated with middle(?) Proterozoic formation of the Missouri gravity low or perhaps earlier
accretion of the Central Plains orogen. The north-northeast fracture set probably resulted from axial-parallel normal faulting in
response to tensional stresses during Keewenawan age rifting of the
Midcontinent rift system, but it is also possible that both the
gross rift trend and subsidiary fault locations may also have been
largely controlled by older crustal weaknesses.

This bimodal fracture pattern has been periodically reactivated
differentially throughout Phanerozoic time in response to changes in
crustal stress regimes, due primarily to plate tectonic interactions

at the North American continental margins. This periodic reactiva

tion is expressed as progressive-displacement-through-time (growth)
faults, fault-proximal Paleozoic lithology and thickness changes,
localized Cretaceous intrusive activity, and modern seismicity. The
styles of movement along particular fractures have changed variously
with geologic time and this is probably a function of fracture plane
orientation and principal stress direction. Nearby tectonic events
(eg. Ouchita orogeny, Laramide orogeny) have produced major local
effects and well-constrained paleostress directions for these events
may permit predictive modeling of resultant deformation styles on
the basis of fracture orientations in areas of poor subsurface control (Salina basin for example). Parallel sets of through-going
fractures (Belleville and Nemaha fault zones) could also have acted
as conjugate shear couples, resulting in local reorientation of the
principal horizontal stress, complicating this interpretation procedure considerably. The origin and tectonic history of a given fracture has probably influenced its internal geometry and intrinsic
permeability characteristics. The modern principal horizontal
stress in the Midcontinent is oriented approximately east-northeastwest-southwest. Fracture-geometry considerations aside, knowledge
of subsurface stress orientations might permit predictions of the
relative "openness" (net permeability) of individual fractures or

fracture sets, such as might affect intrafracture fluid movement.

Soil Gas Relations

Hydrogen detected in soil gases undoubtly originates below the

Phanerozoic-Precambrian interface, perhaps from the active serpenti
87

nization of rift-related mafic rocks, perhaps from deep circulation
and mixing of different formation waters, perhaps from deep-crustal
or mantle outgassing. It almost certainly moves vertically primarily through fractures, either dissolved in formation fluids or as
free gas. The present soil-gas sample density is probably insufficient to delineate, with any degree of certainty, the individual
near-surface fracture zones acting as these possible conduits.
Evaluation of the viability of potential future exploitation of
the hydrogen probably hinges on very accurate delineation of the
major fracture zones through which hydrogen could be moving (not
possible in this study due to inadequate data source resolutions),
the presence of suitable sealing horizons (salt?, bentonitic
shales?), and the use of appropriate well drilling and completion

practices.

Future Research

Suggestions for further research related to the fracture pattern of north-central Kansas, the Midcontinent rift system, and the
Kansas hydrogen occurrences include:

1) Digital processing and reinterpretation of the higher resolution (1 mile by 1 mile nominal station spacing) gravity data
presently being acquired over the study area by the Kansas Geological Survey.

2) Acquisition, enhancement, and interpretation of high resolution, low altitude aeromagnetic data.

3) Installation of additional seismic stations to improve loca
88

tional accuracy and provide a lower event-magnitude detection limit.

4) Acquisition of short, high resolution seismic lines across
the Abilene anticline, Washington structure, or Belleville fault to
determine if Phanerozoic deformation is fault-controlled and the
importance of these structural zones at sub-Phanerozoic levels.

5) Acquisition of closely spaced (50 to 200 feet) soil-gas
hydrogen determinations across those linear features spatially correlated with substantial hydrogen anomalies in the present data set
(eg. Chapman Creek) or known surface faults (eg. Ottawa County) to
test for the presence of inar-sutface enhanced gas-flux effects.

6) Evaluation the possible influence of geomorphic and soil
factors (texture, clay mineralogy, moisture content, etc.) on hydrogen anomaly magnitudes.

7) Determination of hydrogen gas contents of any presently
cased petroleum wells and selected ground water wells in the Clay
County, northern Dickinson County, eastern Ottawa County, and northern Saline County area.

8) Rig-side determination of hydrogen content of gases exsolved
from drilling muds during the drilling of all future petroleum tests
in the vicinity of the Midcontinent rift, both in Kansas and elsewhere along its extent.

9) Targetting of a specific fracture zone for testing, use of
directional drilling to increase probability of fracture intersection, and appropriate core analysis and drill-stem testing.

10) Extension of reconnaissance-level sampling to the north and

west to further define the areal extent of the gas occurrences.
